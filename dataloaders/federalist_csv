"Saturday, October 27, 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For in politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives.",1,0,0,0,0,0
An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"You will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I affect not reserves which I do not feel.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have decided.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I shall not, however, multiply professions on this head.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting particulars: THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(1) This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the Union.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is held out in several of the late publications against the new Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Wednesday, October 31, 1787 JAY To the People of the State of New York: WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will be evident.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is well worthy of consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest of the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that object.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in a division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of the number.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western sons of liberty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world, running at convenient distances, present them with highways for the easy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and exchange of their various commodities.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and independence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To all general purposes we have uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same national rights, privileges, and protection.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a nation we have made peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as a nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with foreign states.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They formed it almost as soon as they had a political existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and well-balanced government for a free people.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they observed the danger which immediately threatened the former and more remotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both could only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they as with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take that important subject under consideration.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to BLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject demand, and which it certainly ought to receive.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But this (as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished than expected, that it may be so considered and examined.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of 1774.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the event proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the dictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good, were indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject the advice of that patriotic Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Many, indeed, were deceived and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.",1,0,0,0,0,0
They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and experienced men.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That, being convened from different parts of the country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of useful information.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That, in the course of the time they passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That they were individually interested in the public liberty and prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature deliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took their advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter them from it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if the people at large had reason to confide in the men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally known, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and advice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most distinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political information, were also members of this convention, and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its Union.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people in forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to adopt.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"With what propriety, therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform attachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons, which I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the Union in the utmost jeopardy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That certainly would be the case, and I sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America will have reason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: FAREWELL!",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Saturday, November 3, 1787 JAY To the People of the State of New York: IT IS not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like the Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their interests.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That consideration naturally tends to create great respect for the high opinion which the people of America have so long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for all general and national purposes.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that they are cogent and conclusive.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY seems to be the first.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and comprehensively.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"At present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from FOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising from domestic causes.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As the former of these comes first in order, it is proper it should be the first discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial Union, under an efficient national government, affords them the best security that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the causes, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes of war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America; for if it should turn out that United America will probably give the fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation of treaties or from direct violence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"America has already formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except Prussia, are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She has also extensive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and, with respect to the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the laws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by three or four distinct confederacies.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Because when once an efficient national government is established, the best men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will generally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country, or other contracted influence, may place men in State assemblies, or senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more general and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national government,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and never experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, it will result that the administration, the political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of individual States, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to other nations, as well as more SAFE with respect to us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, under the national government, treaties and articles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in one sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on the same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four confederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as well from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by different and independent governments, as from the different local laws and interests which may affect and influence them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The wisdom of the convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national government, cannot be too much commended.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the governing party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and consequently having little or no influence on the national government, the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be preserved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great weight to this reasoning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, even if the governing party in a State should be disposed to resist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do, result from circumstances peculiar to the State, and may affect a great number of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be able, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the aggressors.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the national government, not being affected by those local circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are less to be apprehended under one general government than under several lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of the people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national government affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort than can be derived from any other quarter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and interests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the Union.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are several instances of Indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering on some States and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more immediately to the borderers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bordering States, if any, will be those who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of apparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence, to excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately interested.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national government, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and settle them amicably.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They will be more temperate and cool, and in that respect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly than the offending State.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The pride of states, as well as of men, naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The national government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united nation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a State or confederacy of little consideration or power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis XIV., endeavored to appease him.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"He demanded that they should send their Doge, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to FRANCE, to ask his pardon and receive his terms.",1,1,0,1,1,0

4 The Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence) For the Independent Journal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wednesday, November 7, 1787 JAY To the People of the State of New York: MY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to by JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be more easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the State governments or the proposed little confederacies.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the safety of the people of America against dangers from FOREIGN force depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST causes of war to other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not to INVITE hostility or insult; for it need not be observed that there are PRETENDED as well as just causes of war.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"But, independent of these inducements to war, which are more prevalent in absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there are others which affect nations as often as kings; and some of them will on examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and circumstances.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: ASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several States, in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy, would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity, with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would attend such a situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"War between the States, in the first period of their separate existence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments have long obtained.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy, have, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their introduction.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Formerly, an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively small force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aid of posts, is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprises of one much more considerable.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations: In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0

HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently delineated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the industrious manufacturer,--all orders of men, look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has, from indubitable experience, received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them, and has proved, to the satisfaction of their friends, that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been found in various countries that, in proportion as commerce has flourished, land has risen in value.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how could it have happened otherwise?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Could that which procures a freer vent for the products of the earth, which furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land, which is the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a state--could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry, in every shape, fail to augment that article, which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an adversary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a spirit of ill-informed jealousy, or of too great abstraction and refinement, is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason and conviction.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The hereditary dominions of the Emperor of Germany contain a great extent of fertile, cultivated, and populous territory, a large proportion of which is situated in mild and luxuriant climates.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And yet, from the want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch can boast but slender revenues.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tax laws have in vain been multiplied; new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained empty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The popular system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
No person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be surprised at this circumstance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In so opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts, and from excises.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The pockets of the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies, in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the imperceptible agency of taxes on consumption.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general Union.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce, so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from that source.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more simple and efficacious, so far it must serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties more productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to increase the rate without prejudice to trade.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The relative situation of these States; the number of rivers with which they are intersected, and of bays that wash there shores; the facility of communication in every direction; the affinity of language and manners; the familiar habits of intercourse;--all these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty, and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The temper of our governments, for a long time to come, would not permit those rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard the avenues into their respective countries, as well by land as by water; and which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of avarice.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"This shows the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic, where there is an inland communication, and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country would be encumbered, if by disunion the States should be placed in a situation, with respect to each other, resembling that of France with respect to her neighbors.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Revenue, therefore, must be had at all events.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this country, if the principal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight upon land.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been already intimated that excises, in their true signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the people, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor, indeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture, are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that way.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Personal estate (as has been before remarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be subjected to large contributions, by any other means than by taxes on consumption.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In populous cities, it may be enough the subject of conjecture, to occasion the oppression of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the State; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure, escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As the necessities of the State, nevertheless, must be satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of other resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the possessors of land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as, on the other hand, the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its security.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of the soil.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently stand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and resources.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: THE tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or communities, in their political capacities, as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it, is equally attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind, of which we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in those systems.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"I shall content myself with barely observing here, that of all the confederacies of antiquity, which history has handed down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there remain vestiges of them, appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken principle, and were accordingly those which have best deserved, and have most liberally received, the applauding suffrages of political writers.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This exceptionable principle may, as truly as emphatically, be styled the parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies in the members of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring; and that whenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is force, and the immediate effect of the use of it, civil war.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"If there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national government it would either not be able to employ force at all, or, when this could be done, it would amount to a war between parts of the Confederacy concerning the infractions of a league, in which the strongest combination would be most likely to prevail, whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general authority.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"This would be the more likely to take place, as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers, with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement; the better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent States.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"It is therefore improbable that there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory; and the possession of them, for that reason, would contribute nothing to the dignity, to the importance, or to the splendor of the national government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But let it be admitted, for argument's sake, that mere wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition; still it may be safely affirmed, that the sense of the constituent body of the national representatives, or, in other words, the people of the several States, would control the indulgence of so extravagant an appetite.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form, supported only by bold assertions, without the appearance of argument; without even the sanction of theoretical opinions; in contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the general sense of America, as expressed in most of the existing constitutions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The proprietary of this remark will appear, the moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation, in the article of military establishments; a principle unheard of, except in one or two of our State constitutions, and rejected in all the rest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A stranger to our politics, who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture, without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention, would be naturally led to one of two conclusions: either that it contained a positive injunction, that standing armies should be kept up in time of peace; or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops, without subjecting his discretion, in any shape, to the control of the legislature.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he would be surprised to discover, that neither the one nor the other was the case; that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the LEGISLATURE, not in the EXECUTIVE; that this legislature was to be a popular body, consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected; and that instead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies, there was to be found, in respect to this object, an important qualification even of the legislative discretion, in that clause which forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of it, will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident necessity.",1,1,0,1,1,0

"If, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in review the several State constitutions, how great would be his disappointment to find that TWO ONLY of them(1) contained an interdiction of standing armies in time of peace; that the other eleven had either observed a profound silence on the subject, or had in express terms admitted the right of the Legislature to authorize their existence.",1,0,0,0,0,0

29 Concerning the Militia From the New York Packet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wednesday, January 9, 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties of superintending the common defense, and of watching over the internal peace of the Confederacy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Wednesday, January 2, 1788.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the State governments from a power in the Union to control them in the levies of money, because I am persuaded that the sense of the people, the extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the State governments, and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations for local purposes, would be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power; yet I am willing here to allow, in its full extent, the justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual States should possess an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And making this concession, I affirm that (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports) they would, under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of it, would be a violent assumption of power, unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"An entire consolidation of the States into one complete national sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts; and whatever powers might remain in them, would be altogether dependent on the general will.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But as the plan of the convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation, the State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, EXCLUSIVELY delegated to the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This exclusive delegation, or rather this alienation, of State sovereignty, would only exist in three cases: where the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to the Union, and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I use these terms to distinguish this last case from another which might appear to resemble it, but which would, in fact, be essentially different; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration, but would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority.",1,0,0,0,0,0
These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the following instances: The last clause but one in the eighth section of the first article provides expressly that Congress shall exercise EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION over the district to be appropriated as the seat of government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This answers to the first case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first clause of the same section empowers Congress to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises; and the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares that, NO STATE SHALL, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except for the purpose of executing its inspection laws.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence would result an exclusive power in the Union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clause, which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State; in consequence of which qualification, it now only extends to the DUTIES ON IMPORTS.",1,0,0,0,0,0

There is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that power EXCLUSIVE in the Union.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the States from exercising it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So far is this from being the case, that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in relation to duties on imports and exports.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This restriction implies an admission that, if it were not inserted, the States would possess the power it excludes; and it implies a further admission, that as to all other taxes, the authority of the States remains undiminished.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In any other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecessary, because if the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the exclusion of the States, or even their subordination in this particular, there could be no need of such a restriction; it would be dangerous, because the introduction of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned, and which, if the reasoning of the objectors be just, could not have been intended; I mean that the States, in all cases to which the restriction did not apply, would have a concurrent power of taxation with the Union.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT that is, a NEGATION of one thing, and an AFFIRMANCE of another; a negation of the authority of the States to impose taxes on imports and exports, and an affirmance of their authority to impose them on all other articles.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be mere sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY from the imposition of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL of the national legislature.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The restraining or prohibitory clause only says, that they shall not, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS, lay such duties; and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned, the Constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for the sake of a very absurd conclusion; which is, that the States, WITH THE CONSENT of the national legislature, might tax imports and exports; and that they might tax every other article, UNLESS CONTROLLED by the same body.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this was the intention, why not leave it, in the first instance, to what is alleged to be the natural operation of the original clause, conferring a general power of taxation upon the Union?",1,0,0,0,0,0

"As to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the States and in the Union, it cannot be supported in that sense which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is, indeed, possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a State which might render it INEXPEDIENT that thus a further tax should be laid on the same article by the Union; but it would not imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The quantity of the imposition, the expediency or inexpediency of an increase on either side, would be mutually questions of prudence; but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The particular policy of the national and of the State systems of finance might now and then not exactly coincide, and might require reciprocal forbearances.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not, however a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results from the division of the sovereign power; and the rule that all authorities, of which the States are not explicitly divested in favor of the Union, remain with them in full vigor, is not a theoretical consequence of that division, but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the proposed Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The tenth section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0

35 The Same Subject Continued (Concerning the General Power of Taxation) For the Independent Journal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saturday, January 5, 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite power of taxation in the Union, I shall make one general remark; which is, that if the jurisdiction of the national government, in the article of revenue, should be restricted to particular objects, it would naturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall upon those objects.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Two evils would spring from this source: the oppression of particular branches of industry; and an unequal distribution of the taxes, as well among the several States as among the citizens of the same State.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Suppose, as has been contended for, the federal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government, for want of being able to command other resources, would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There are persons who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a length; since the higher they are, the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant consumption, to produce a favorable balance of trade, and to promote domestic manufactures.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But all extremes are pernicious in various ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general spirit of smuggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue itself: they tend to render other classes of the community tributary, in an improper degree, to the manufacturing classes, to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets; they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with less advantage; and in the last place, they oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overstocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only exhausts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"I am apt to think that a division of the duty, between the seller and the buyer, more often happens than is commonly imagined.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The merchant, especially in a country of small commercial capital, is often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more expeditious sale.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener true than the reverse of the proposition, that it is far more equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common stock, than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is not so generally true as to render it equitable, that those duties should form the only national fund.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional tax upon the importing State, whose citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of consumers.",1,0,0,0,0,0
In this view they are productive of inequality among the States; which inequality would be increased with the increased extent of the duties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts would be attended with inequality, from a different cause, between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The States which can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants, by their own manufactures, will not, according to their numbers or wealth, consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those States which are not in the same favorable situation.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They would not, therefore, in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to excises, the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures.",0,0,0,0,0,0
New York is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the Union to external taxation may be aware of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"New York is an importing State, and is not likely speedily to be, to any great extent, a manufacturing State.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She would, of course, suffer in a double light from restraining the jurisdiction of the Union to commercial imposts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be observed, conformably to a remark made in another part of these papers, that the interest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such an extreme.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I readily admit that this would be the case, as long as other resources were open; but if the avenues to them were closed, HOPE, stimulated by necessity, would beget experiments, fortified by rigorous precautions and additional penalties, which, for a time, would have the intended effect, till there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new precautions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The first success would be apt to inspire false opinions, which it might require a long course of subsequent experience to correct.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Necessity, especially in politics, often occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a system of measures correspondingly erroneous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But even if this supposed excess should not be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of taxation, the inequalities spoken of would still ensue, though not in the same degree, from the other causes that have been noticed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us now return to the examination of objections.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One which, if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition, seems most to be relied on, is, that the House of Representatives is not sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different classes of citizens, in order to combine the interests and feelings of every part of the community, and to produce a due sympathy between the representative body and its constituents.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This argument presents itself under a very specious and seducing form; and is well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is addressed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But when we come to dissect it with attention, it will appear to be made up of nothing but fair-sounding words.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The object it seems to aim at is, in the first place, impracticable, and in the sense in which it is contended for, is unnecessary.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I reserve for another place the discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the representative body in respect to numbers, and shall content myself with examining here the particular use which has been made of a contrary supposition, in reference to the immediate subject of our inquiries.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people, by persons of each class, is altogether visionary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unless it were expressly provided in the Constitution, that each different occupation should send one or more members, the thing would never take place in practice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined, with few exceptions, to give their votes to merchants, in preference to persons of their own professions or trades.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Those discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise and industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Many of them, indeed, are immediately connected with the operations of commerce.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware, that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They are sensible that their habits in life have not been such as to give them those acquired endowments, without which, in a deliberative assembly, the greatest natural abilities are for the most part useless; and that the influence and weight, and superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the public councils, unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"These considerations, and many others that might be mentioned prove, and experience confirms it, that artisans and manufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and those whom they recommend.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We must therefore consider merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With regard to the learned professions, little need be observed; they truly form no distinct interest in society, and according to their situation and talents, will be indiscriminately the objects of the confidence and choice of each other, and of other parts of the community.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Nothing remains but the landed interest; and this, in a political view, and particularly in relation to taxes, I take to be perfectly united, from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest tenant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No tax can be laid on land which will not affect the proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a single acre.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Every landholder will therefore have a common interest to keep the taxes on land as low as possible; and common interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of sympathy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer, what reason is there to conclude, that the first would stand a better chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the last?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we take fact as our guide, and look into our own senate and assembly, we shall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both; nor is this less the case in the senate, which consists of a smaller number, than in the assembly, which is composed of a greater number.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Where the qualifications of the electors are the same, whether they have to choose a small or a large number, their votes will fall upon those in whom they have most confidence; whether these happen to be men of large fortunes, or of moderate property, or of no property at all.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said to be necessary, that all classes of citizens should have some of their own number in the representative body, in order that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and attended to.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But we have seen that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where this is the case, the representative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the government, will be composed of landholders, merchants, and men of the learned professions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of men?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And will he not, from his own interest in that species of property, be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber it?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Will not the merchant understand and be disposed to cultivate, as far as may be proper, the interests of the mechanic and manufacturing arts, to which his commerce is so nearly allied?",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Will not the man of the learned profession, who will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of industry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them, ready to promote either, so far as it shall appear to him conducive to the general interests of the society?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the society, and to which a wise administration will never be inattentive, is the man whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less likely to be a competent judge of their nature, extent, and foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and acquaintances?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favor of the people, and who is dependent on the suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors, should take care to inform himself of their dispositions and inclinations, and should be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This dependence, and the necessity of being bound himself, and his posterity, by the laws to which he gives his assent, are the true, and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the representative and the constituent.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"There is no part of the administration of government that requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political economy, so much as the business of taxation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The man who understands those principles best will be least likely to resort to oppressive expedients, or sacrifice any particular class of citizens to the procurement of revenue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It might be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always be the least burdensome.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exercise of the power of taxation, it is necessary that the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general genius, habits, and modes of thinking of the people at large, and with the resources of the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is all that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The door ought to be equally open to all; and I trust, for the credit of human nature, that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of State legislation; but occasional instances of this sort will not render the reasoning founded upon the general course of things, less conclusive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The subject might be placed in several other lights that would all lead to the same result; and in particular it might be asked, What greater affinity or relation of interest can be conceived between the carpenter and blacksmith, and the linen manufacturer or stocking weaver, than between the merchant and either of them?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is notorious that there are often as great rivalships between different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts as there are between any of the departments of labor and industry; so that, unless the representative body were to be far more numerous than would be consistent with any idea of regularity or wisdom in its deliberations, it is impossible that what seems to be the spirit of the objection we have been considering should ever be realized in practice.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But I forbear to dwell any longer on a matter which has hitherto worn too loose a garb to admit even of an accurate inspection of its real shape or tendency.,1,0,0,0,0,0
There is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature that claims our attention.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But as the ultimate object of these papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this Constitution, and the expediency of adopting it, our plan cannot be complete without taking a more critical and thorough survey of the work of the convention, without examining it on all its sides, comparing it in all its parts, and calculating its probable effects.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That this remaining task may be executed under impressions conducive to a just and fair result, some reflections must in this place be indulged, which candor previously suggests.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a misfortune, inseparable from human affairs, that public measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance or obstruct the public good; and that this spirit is more apt to be diminished than promoted, by those occasions which require an unusual exercise of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To those who have been led by experience to attend to this consideration, it could not appear surprising, that the act of the convention, which recommends so many important changes and innovations, which may be viewed in so many lights and relations, and which touches the springs of so many passions and interests, should find or excite dispositions unfriendly, both on one side and on the other, to a fair discussion and accurate judgment of its merits.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In some, it has been too evident from their own publications, that they have scanned the proposed Constitution, not only with a predisposition to censure, but with a predetermination to condemn; as the language held by others betrays an opposite predetermination or bias, which must render their opinions also of little moment in the question.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"It is but just to remark in favor of the latter description, that as our situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical, and to require indispensably that something should be done for our relief, the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have taken his bias from the weight of these considerations, as well as from considerations of a sinister nature.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"They must have reflected, that in all great changes of established governments, forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former, would render nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the people to abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,(2) since it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object; and it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some INFORMAL AND UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number of citizens.",1,0,0,0,0,0

This class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors, speak their own propriety.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Both of them are comprised in the articles of Confederation, with this difference only, that the former is disembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an exception, under which treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the States; and that a power of appointing and receiving other public ministers and consuls, is expressly and very properly added to the former provision concerning ambassadors.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The utility of this power will scarcely be questioned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of individuals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The States cannot separately make effectual provisions for either of the cases, and most of them have anticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the instance of Congress.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States; and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of government, carries its own evidence with it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a power exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of its general supremacy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This consideration has the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as still further to abridge its necessary independence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The extent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people of the State in their adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be obviated.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The necessity of a like authority over forts, magazines, etc., established by the general government, is not less evident.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The public money expended on such places, and the public property deposited in them, requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the particular State.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Nor would it be proper for the places on which the security of the entire Union may depend, to be in any degree dependent on a particular member of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"All objections and scruples are here also obviated, by requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in every such establishment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attained.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As treason may be committed against the United States, the authority of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To admit new States into the Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the consent of the legislatures of the States concerned, as well as of the Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the articles of Confederation, no provision is found on this important subject.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Canada was to be admitted of right, on her joining in the measures of the United States; and the other COLONIES, by which were evidently meant the other British colonies, at the discretion of nine States.",1,1,1,1,1,1
The eventual establishment of NEW STATES seems to have been overlooked by the compilers of that instrument.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We have seen the inconvenience of this omission, and the assumption of power into which Congress have been led by it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"With great propriety, therefore, has the new system supplied the defect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The general precaution, that no new States shall be formed, without the concurrence of the federal authority, and that of the States concerned, is consonant to the principles which ought to govern such transactions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The particular precaution against the erection of new States, by the partition of a State without its consent, quiets the jealousy of the larger States; as that of the smaller is quieted by a like precaution, against a junction of States without their consent.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, with a proviso, that nothing in the Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular State.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a power of very great importance, and required by considerations similar to those which show the propriety of the former.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The proviso annexed is proper in itself, and was probably rendered absolutely necessary by jealousies and questions concerning the Western territory sufficiently known to the public.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government; to protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In a confederacy founded on republican principles, and composed of republican members, the superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial innovations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The more intimate the nature of such a union may be, the greater interest have the members in the political institutions of each other; and the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into should be SUBSTANTIALLY maintained.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But a right implies a remedy; and where else could the remedy be deposited, than where it is deposited by the Constitution?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort, than those of a kindred nature.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the confederate republic of Germany, says Montesquieu, consists of free cities and petty states, subject to different princes, experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Greece was undone, he adds, as soon as the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the Amphictyons.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the latter case, no doubt, the disproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form, of the new confederate, had its share of influence on the events.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may possibly be asked, what need there could be of such a precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the State governments, without the concurrence of the States themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
These questions admit of ready answers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the interposition of the general government should not be needed, the provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in the Constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But who can say what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular States, by the ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To the second question it may be answered, that if the general government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority, it will be, of course, bound to pursue the authority.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the authority extends no further than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of government, which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which is to be guaranteed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As long, therefore, as the existing republican forms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the federal Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Whenever the States may choose to substitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so, and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The only restriction imposed on them is, that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions; a restriction which, it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a grievance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
A protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts composing it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The latitude of the expression here used seems to secure each State, not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The history, both of ancient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this article.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Protection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been remarked, that even among the Swiss cantons, which, properly speaking, are not under one government, provision is made for this object; and the history of that league informs us that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the most democratic, as the other cantons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A recent and well-known event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like nature.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At first view, it might seem not to square with the republican theory, to suppose, either that a majority have not the right, or that a minority will have the force, to subvert a government; and consequently, that the federal interposition can never be required, but when it would be improper.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But theoretic reasoning, in this as in most other cases, must be qualified by the lessons of practice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why may not illicit combinations, for purposes of violence, be formed as well by a majority of a State, especially a small State as by a majority of a county, or a district of the same State; and if the authority of the State ought, in the latter case, to protect the local magistracy, ought not the federal authority, in the former, to support the State authority?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Besides, there are certain parts of the State constitutions which are so interwoven with the federal Constitution, that a violent blow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Insurrections in a State will rarely induce a federal interposition, unless the number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be much better that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the superintending power, than that the majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The existence of a right to interpose, will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"May not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of military talents and experience, or of secret succors from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"May not a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same side, against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election!",0,0,0,0,0,0
"May it not happen, in fine, that the minority of CITIZENS may become a majority of PERSONS, by the accession of alien residents, of a casual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom the constitution of the State has not admitted to the rights of suffrage?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I take no notice of an unhappy species of population abounding in some of the States, who, during the calm of regular government, are sunk below the level of men; but who, in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge into the human character, and give a superiority of strength to any party with which they may associate themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies, what better umpires could be desired by two violent factions, flying to arms, and tearing a State to pieces, than the representatives of confederate States, not heated by the local flame?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To the impartiality of judges, they would unite the affection of friends.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Happy would it be if such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments; if a project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of mankind!,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Should it be asked, what is to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the States, and comprising a superiority of the entire force, though not a constitutional right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"the answer must be, that such a case, as it would be without the compass of human remedies, so it is fortunately not within the compass of human probability; and that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal Constitution, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which no possible constitution can provide a cure.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Montesquieu, an important one is, that should a popular insurrection happen in one of the States, the others are able to quell it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To consider all debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this Constitution, as being no less valid against the United States, under this Constitution, than under the Confederation.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This can only be considered as a declaratory proposition; and may have been inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of the foreign creditors of the United States, who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine, that a change in the political form of civil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral obligations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Among the lesser criticisms which have been exercised on the Constitution, it has been remarked that the validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of the United States, as well as against them; and in the spirit which usually characterizes little critics, the omission has been transformed and magnified into a plot against the national rights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The authors of this discovery may be told, what few others need to be informed of, that as engagements are in their nature reciprocal, an assertion of their validity on one side, necessarily involves a validity on the other side; and that as the article is merely declaratory, the establishment of the principle in one case is sufficient for every case.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They may be further told, that every constitution must limit its precautions to dangers that are not altogether imaginary; and that no real danger can exist that the government would DARE, with, or even without, this constitutional declaration before it, to remit the debts justly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned.",1,0,0,0,0,0
To provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of the States under two exceptions only.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That useful alterations will be suggested by experience, could not but be foreseen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was requisite, therefore, that a mode for introducing them should be provided.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The mode preferred by the convention seems to be stamped with every mark of propriety.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It guards equally against that extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered faults.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It, moreover, equally enables the general and the State governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the Senate, was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary sovereignty of the States, implied and secured by that principle of representation in one branch of the legislature; and was probably insisted on by the States particularly attached to that equality.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The other exception must have been admitted on the same considerations which produced the privilege defended by it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the States, ratifying the same.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This article speaks for itself.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The express authority of the people alone could give due validity to the Constitution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen States, would have subjected the essential interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single member.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would have marked a want of foresight in the convention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcusable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Two questions of a very delicate nature present themselves on this occasion: 1.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On what principle the Confederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the States, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of the parties to it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What relation is to subsist between the nine or more States ratifying the Constitution, and the remaining few who do not become parties to it?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of self-preservation; to the transcendent law of nature and of nature's God, which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"PERHAPS, also, an answer may be found without searching beyond the principles of the compact itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been heretofore noted among the defects of the Confederation, that in many of the States it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation on the other States should be reduced to the same standard.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"A compact between independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts of legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach, committed by either of the parties, absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and void.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the MULTIPLIED and IMPORTANT infractions with which they may be confronted?",1,0,0,0,0,0
The time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The scene is now changed, and with it the part which the same motives dictate.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The second question is not less delicate; and the flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It is one of those cases which must be left to provide for itself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In general, it may be observed, that although no political relation can subsist between the assenting and dissenting States, yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The claims of justice, both on one side and on the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected; whilst considerations of a common interest, and, above all, the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are past, and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to reunion, will, it is hoped, not urge in vain MODERATION on one side, and PRUDENCE on the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
44 Restrictions on the Authority of the Several States From the New York Packet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Friday, January 25, 1788.",0,0,0,0,0,0
MADISON To the People of the State of New York: A FIFTH class of provisions in favor of the federal authority consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the several States: 1.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The prohibition against treaties, alliances, and confederations makes a part of the existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need no explanation, is copied into the new Constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The prohibition of letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is somewhat extended in the new.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to the former, letters of marque could be granted by the States after a declaration of war; according to the latter, these licenses must be obtained, as well during war as previous to its declaration, from the government of the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The right of coining money, which is here taken from the States, was left in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent right with that of Congress, under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of Congress to regulate the alloy and value.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In this instance, also, the new provision is an improvement on the old.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whilst the alloy and value depended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the particular States could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The latter inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally submitted to the federal head; and as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints established under the general authority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In addition to these persuasive considerations, it may be observed, that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States, and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be kindled among the States themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money, than to coin gold or silver.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the States, on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights; and I am much deceived if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their constituents.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the more-industrious and less-informed part of the community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have seen, too, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The prohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of Confederation and needs no comment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The restraint on the power of the States over imports and exports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is needless, therefore, to remark further on this head, than that the manner in which the restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to the States a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United States a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings which are either so obvious, or have been so fully developed, that they may be passed over without remark.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The SIXTH and last class consists of the several powers and provisions by which efficacy is given to all the rest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of these the first is, the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no part can appear more completely invulnerable.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Without the SUBSTANCE of this power, the whole Constitution would be a dead letter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those who object to the article, therefore, as a part of the Constitution, can only mean that the FORM of the provision is improper.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are four other possible methods which the Constitution might have taken on this subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They might have copied the second article of the existing Confederation, which would have prohibited the exercise of any power not EXPRESSLY delegated; they might have attempted a positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms necessary and proper; they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them, by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition; they might have been altogether silent on the subject, leaving these necessary and proper powers to construction and inference.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Had the convention taken the first method of adopting the second article of Confederation, it is evident that the new Congress would be continually exposed, as their predecessors have been, to the alternative of construing the term EXPRESSLY with so much rigor, as to disarm the government of all real authority whatever, or with so much latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be easy to show, if it were necessary, that no important power, delegated by the articles of Confederation, has been or can be executed by Congress, without recurring more or less to the doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or IMPLICATION.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the powers delegated under the new system are more extensive, the government which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing nothing, or of violating the Constitution by exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper, but, at the same time, not EXPRESSLY granted.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the celebrated Montesquieu.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics, he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of mankind.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Let us endeavor, in the first place, to ascertain his meaning on this point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The British Constitution was to Montesquieu what Homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the latter have considered the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by which all similar works were to be judged, so this great political critic appears to have viewed the Constitution of England as the standard, or to use his own expression, as the mirror of political liberty; and to have delivered, in the form of elementary truths, the several characteristic principles of that particular system.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"That we may be sure, then, not to mistake his meaning in this case, let us recur to the source from which the maxim was drawn.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"On the slightest view of the British Constitution, we must perceive that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The executive magistrate forms an integral part of the legislative authority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which, when made, have, under certain limitations, the force of legislative acts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him, can be removed by him on the address of the two Houses of Parliament, and form, when he pleases to consult them, one of his constitutional councils.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"One branch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional council to the executive chief, as, on another hand, it is the sole depositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment, and is invested with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The judges, again, are so far connected with the legislative department as often to attend and participate in its deliberations, though not admitted to a legislative vote.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"From these facts, by which Montesquieu was guided, it may clearly be inferred that, in saying There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates, or, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers, he did not mean that these departments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in, or no CONTROL over, the acts of each other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"His meaning, as his own words import, and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye, can amount to no more than this, that where the WHOLE power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the WHOLE power of another department, the fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"This would have been the case in the constitution examined by him, if the king, who is the sole executive magistrate, had possessed also the complete legislative power, or the supreme administration of justice; or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme judiciary, or the supreme executive authority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This, however, is not among the vices of that constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The entire legislature, again, can exercise no executive prerogative, though one of its branches constitutes the supreme executive magistracy, and another, on the impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the subordinate officers in the executive department.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body, says he, there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical manner.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Were it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of these reasons are more fully explained in other passages; but briefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find that, notwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"New Hampshire, whose constitution was the last formed, seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments, and has qualified the doctrine by declaring that the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate from, and independent of, each other AS THE NATURE OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WILL ADMIT; OR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CHAIN OF CONNECTION THAT BINDS THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE INDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND AMITY.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"This declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of Montesquieu, as it has been explained, and is not in a single point violated by the plan of the convention.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"I pass over the constitutions of Rhode Island and Connecticut, because they were formed prior to the Revolution, and even before the principle under examination had become an object of political attention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The constitution of New York contains no declaration on this subject; but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of improperly blending the different departments.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"MADISON To the People of the State of New York: THE author of the Notes on the State of Virginia, quoted in the last paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught of a constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid before a convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the legislature, for the establishment of a constitution for that commonwealth.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks a turn of thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate; and is the more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent attachment to republican government and an enlightened view of the dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power against the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps altogether his own, and as it immediately relates to the subject of our present inquiry, ought not to be overlooked.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"As the people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived, it seems strictly consonant to the republican theory, to recur to the same original authority, not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge, diminish, or new-model the powers of the government, but also whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their respective powers; and how are the encroachments of the stronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be redressed, without an appeal to the people themselves, who, as the grantors of the commissions, can alone declare its true meaning, and enforce its observance?",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Without presuming to undertake a full development of this important idea, I will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and structure of the government planned by the convention.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"If the principles on which these observations are founded be just, as I persuade myself they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the several State constitutions, and to the federal Constitution it will be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond with them, the former are infinitely less able to bear such a test.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"It can be little doubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the popular form of government within such narrow limits would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great variety of interests, parties, and sects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place on any other principles than those of justice and the general good; whilst there being thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there must be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the former, by introducing into the government a will not dependent on the latter, or, in other words, a will independent of the society itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"MADISON To the People of the State of New York: FROM the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers, I pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts of the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I shall begin with the House of Representatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first view to be taken of this part of the government relates to the qualifications of the electors and the elected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those of the former are to be the same with those of the electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and establish this right in the Constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To have left it open for the occasional regulation of the Congress, would have been improper for the reason just mentioned.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To have submitted it to the legislative discretion of the States, would have been improper for the same reason; and for the additional reason that it would have rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the people alone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To have reduced the different qualifications in the different States to one uniform rule, would probably have been as dissatisfactory to some of the States as it would have been difficult to the convention.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The provision made by the convention appears, therefore, to be the best that lay within their option.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It must be satisfactory to every State, because it is conformable to the standard already established, or which may be established, by the State itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be safe to the United States, because, being fixed by the State constitutions, it is not alterable by the State governments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the States will alter this part of their constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The qualifications of the elected, being less carefully and properly defined by the State constitutions, and being at the same time more susceptible of uniformity, have been very properly considered and regulated by the convention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A representative of the United States must be of the age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a citizen of the United States; must, at the time of his election, be an inhabitant of the State he is to represent; and, during the time of his service, must be in no office under the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The term for which the representatives are to be elected falls under a second view which may be taken of this branch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to decide on the propriety of this article, two questions must be considered: first, whether biennial elections will, in this case, be safe; secondly, whether they be necessary or useful.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people, so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what particular degree of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose, does not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation, and must depend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be connected.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Let us consult experience, the guide that ought always to be followed whenever it can be found.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The scheme of representation, as a substitute for a meeting of the citizens in person, being at most but very imperfectly known to ancient polity, it is in more modern times only that we are to expect instructive examples.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And even here, in order to avoid a research too vague and diffusive, it will be proper to confine ourselves to the few examples which are best known, and which bear the greatest analogy to our particular case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first to which this character ought to be applied, is the House of Commons in Great Britain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The history of this branch of the English Constitution, anterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too obscure to yield instruction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The very existence of it has been made a question among political antiquaries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The earliest records of subsequent date prove that parliaments were to SIT only every year; not that they were to be ELECTED every year.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And even these annual sessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch, that, under various pretexts, very long and dangerous intermissions were often contrived by royal ambition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To remedy this grievance, it was provided by a statute in the reign of Charles II, that the intermissions should not be protracted beyond a period of three years.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"On the accession of William III, when a revolution took place in the government, the subject was still more seriously resumed, and it was declared to be among the fundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be held FREQUENTLY.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"By another statute, which passed a few years later in the same reign, the term frequently, which had alluded to the triennial period settled in the time of Charles II, is reduced to a precise meaning, it being expressly enacted that a new parliament shall be called within three years after the termination of the former.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The last change, from three to seven years, is well known to have been introduced pretty early in the present century, under on alarm for the Hanoverian succession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"From these facts it appears that the greatest frequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that kingdom, for binding the representatives to their constituents, does not exceed a triennial return of them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we may argue from the degree of liberty retained even under septennial elections, and all the other vicious ingredients in the parliamentary constitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of the period from seven to three years, with the other necessary reforms, would so far extend the influence of the people over their representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections, under the federal system, cannot possibly be dangerous to the requisite dependence of the House of Representatives on their constituents.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated entirely by the discretion of the crown, and were seldom repeated, except on the accession of a new prince, or some other contingent event.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The parliament which commenced with George II.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"was continued throughout his whole reign, a period of about thirty-five years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only dependence of the representatives on the people consisted in the right of the latter to supply occasional vacancies by the election of new members, and in the chance of some event which might produce a general new election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights of their constituents, so far as the disposition might exist, was extremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects of their deliberation.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"What effect may be produced by this partial reform, must be left to further experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The example of Ireland, from this view of it, can throw but little light on the subject.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as we can draw any conclusion from it, it must be that if the people of that country have been able under all these disadvantages to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of biennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty, which might depend on a due connection between their representatives and themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Let us bring our inquiries nearer home.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The example of these States, when British colonies, claims particular attention, at the same time that it is so well known as to require little to be said on it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The principle of representation, in one branch of the legislature at least, was established in all of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the periods of election were different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They varied from one to seven years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have we any reason to infer, from the spirit and conduct of the representatives of the people, prior to the Revolution, that biennial elections would have been dangerous to the public liberties?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the commencement of the struggle, and which vanquished the obstacles to independence, is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of its worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement This remark holds good, as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections were least frequent, as to those whose elections were most frequent Virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting the parliamentary usurpations of Great Britain; it was the first also in espousing, by public act, the resolution of independence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In Virginia, nevertheless, if I have not been misinformed, elections under the former government were septennial.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This particular example is brought into view, not as a proof of any peculiar merit, for the priority in those instances was probably accidental; and still less of any advantage in SEPTENNIAL elections, for when compared with a greater frequency they are inadmissible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a very substantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be in no danger from BIENNIAL elections.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The conclusion resulting from these examples will be not a little strengthened by recollecting three circumstances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first is, that the federal legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative authority which is vested completely in the British Parliament; and which, with a few exceptions, was exercised by the colonial assemblies and the Irish legislature.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a received and well-founded maxim, that where no other circumstances affect the case, the greater the power is, the shorter ought to be its duration; and, conversely, the smaller the power, the more safely may its duration be protracted.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the second place, it has, on another occasion, been shown that the federal legislature will not only be restrained by its dependence on its people, as other legislative bodies are, but that it will be, moreover, watched and controlled by the several collateral legislatures, which other legislative bodies are not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And in the third place, no comparison can be made between the means that will be possessed by the more permanent branches of the federal government for seducing, if they should be disposed to seduce, the House of Representatives from their duty to the people, and the means of influence over the popular branch possessed by the other branches of the government above cited.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The most simple and familiar portion of time, applicable to the subject was that of a year; and hence the doctrine has been inculcated by a laudable zeal, to erect some barrier against the gradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the advance towards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure from the fixed point of annual elections.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The second question stated is, whether biennial elections be necessary or useful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The propriety of answering this question in the affirmative will appear from several very obvious considerations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No man can be a competent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on which he is to legislate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A part of this knowledge may be acquired by means of information which lie within the compass of men in private as well as public stations.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The period of legislative service established in most of the States for the more numerous branch is, as we have seen, one year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The question then may be put into this simple form: does the period of two years bear no greater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal legislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for State legislation?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Tuesday, February 12, 1788.",0,0,0,0,0,0
MADISON To the People of the State of New York: THE next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives relates to the appointment of its members to the several States which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct taxes.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It is not contended that the number of people in each State ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion of those who are to represent the people of each State.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The establishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes, will probably be as little contested; though the rule itself in this case, is by no means founded on the same principle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the former case, the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of the people, with which it has a natural and universal connection.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of which it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases a very unfit one.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the States, it is evidently the least objectionable among the practicable rules, and had too recently obtained the general sanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with the convention.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said; but does it follow, from an admission of numbers for the measure of representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Slaves are considered as property, not as persons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They ought therefore to be comprehended in estimates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of persons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is the objection, as I understand it, stated in its full force.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We subscribe to the doctrine, might one of our Southern brethren observe, that representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the application of this distinction to the case of our slaves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But we must deny the fact, that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no respect whatever as persons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The true state of the case is, that they partake of both these qualities: being considered by our laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as property.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for a master; in being vendible by one master to another master; and in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and chastised in his body, by the capricious will of another--the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and classed with those irrational animals which fall under the legal denomination of property.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"In being protected, on the other hand, in his life and in his limbs, against the violence of all others, even the master of his labor and his liberty; and in being punishable himself for all violence committed against others--the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral person, not as a mere article of property.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"The federal Constitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixed character of persons and of property.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This is in fact their true character.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied, that these are the proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property, that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This question may be placed in another light.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If we review the constitutions of the several States, we shall find that some of them contain no determinate regulations on this subject, that others correspond pretty much on this point with the federal Constitution, and that the most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a mere directory provision.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as experience has taken place on this subject, a gradual increase of representatives under the State constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the constituents, and it appears that the former have been as ready to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
There is a peculiarity in the federal Constitution which insures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the latter.,1,0,0,0,0,0

From this circumstance it may with certainty be inferred that the larger States will be strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature in which their influence predominates.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"The ordinary power of appointment is confined to the President and Senate JOINTLY, and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen IN THEIR RECESS, which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently intended to authorize the President, SINGLY, to make temporary appointments during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The circumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent appointments would, of course, have governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary appointments; and as the national Senate is the body, whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The President will have only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the Union.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their several jurisdictions.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In this article, therefore, the power of the President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies--all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(1) The governor of New York, on the other hand, is by the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its militia and navy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the constitutions of several of the States expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well of the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this instance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than could be claimed by a President of the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to all cases, except those of impeachment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The governor of New York may pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for treason and murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is not the power of the governor, in this article, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than that of the President?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All conspiracies and plots against the government, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be screened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the prerogative of pardoning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a governor of New York, therefore, should be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"A President of the Union, on the other hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in the ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any degree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Would not the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise against the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption from death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design, upon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Would this last expectation have any influence at all, when the probability was computed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might himself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired impunity?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary to recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of treason is limited to levying war upon the United States, and adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort; and that by the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The President can only adjourn the national legislature in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"He can of his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every other description.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"It has been insinuated, that his authority in this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with foreign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the ratification, of Parliament.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"But I believe this doctrine was never heard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Every jurist(2) of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its Constitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of making treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other sanction.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given birth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But this parliamentary interposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new state of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended power of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The one can perform alone what the other can do only with the concurrence of a branch of the legislature.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It must be admitted, that, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would exceed that of any State Executive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this arises naturally from the sovereign power which relates to treaties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the Confederacy were to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the Executives of the several States were not solely invested with that delicate and important prerogative.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other public ministers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the administration of the government; and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be a necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches, upon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to take the place of a departed predecessor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The President is to nominate, and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers, judges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the United States established by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,0

He can confer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an immense number of church preferments.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the governor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The governor claims, and has frequently exercised, the right of nomination, and is entitled to a casting vote in the appointment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this respect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the article of the casting vote.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the national government, if the Senate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the government of New York, if the council should be divided, the governor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"(3) If we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode of appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national legislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the governor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most four, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small number of which a council of appointment consists, than the considerable number of which the national Senate would consist, we cannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate of this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be greatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of the President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to determine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess more or less power than the Governor of New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it appears yet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel which has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a closer group.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President of the United States would be an officer elected by the people for four years; the king of Great Britain is a perpetual and hereditary prince.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The one would have a qualified negative upon the acts of the legislative body; the other has an absolute negative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The one would have a right to command the military and naval forces of the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that of declaring war, and of raising and regulating fleets and armies by his own authority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The one would have a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other is the sole possessor of the power of making treaties.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I clearly concur in opinion, in this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be deep, solid, and ingenious, that the executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE;(2) that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of so small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused, than if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very circumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of influence as when he is associated with others.",1,1,1,1,0,0

71 The Duration in Office of the Executive From the New York Packet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tuesday, March 18, 1788.",0,0,0,0,0,0
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: DURATION in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the energy of the Executive authority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This has relation to two objects: to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate, in the employment of his constitutional powers; and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his auspices.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"With regard to the first, it must be evident, that the longer the duration in office, the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an advantage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a general principle of human nature, that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it; will be less attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title, than to what he enjoys by a durable or certain title; and, of course, will be willing to risk more for the sake of the one, than for the sake of the other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This remark is not less applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or trust, than to any article of ordinary property.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The inference from it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate, under a consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay down his office, will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity, from the independent exertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however transient, which may happen to prevail, either in a considerable part of the society itself, or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If the case should only be, that he MIGHT lay it down, unless continued by a new choice, and if he should be desirous of being continued, his wishes, conspiring with his fears, would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his fortitude.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In either case, feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the station.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in the legislature, as its best recommendation.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But such men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was instituted, as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a just observation, that the people commonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This often applies to their very errors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But their good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of promoting it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the snares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate, by the artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When occasions present themselves, in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the Executive to the inclinations of the people, we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the legislature.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the former, and at other times the people may be entirely neutral.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In either supposition, it is certainly desirable that the Executive should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and decision.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power, teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To what purpose separate the executive or the judiciary from the legislative, if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of the legislative?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Such a separation must be merely nominal, and incapable of producing the ends for which it was established.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent on the legislative body.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first comports with, the last violates, the fundamental principles of good government; and, whatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power in the same hands.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in some preceding numbers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In governments purely republican, this tendency is almost irresistible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The representatives of the people, in a popular assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves, and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter; as if the exercise of its rights, by either the executive or judiciary, were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the other departments; and as they commonly have the people on their side, they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the Constitution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature, unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"Another answer, perhaps more obvious, though not more conclusive, will result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative body over the people; which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man who, by an upright resistance to any sinister project of that body, should have made himself obnoxious to its resentment.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be asked also, whether a duration of four years would answer the end proposed; and if it would not, whether a less period, which would at least be recommended by greater security against ambitious designs, would not, for that reason, be preferable to a longer period, which was, at the same time, too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the magistrate.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years, or any other limited duration, would completely answer the end proposed; but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the spirit and character of the government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Between the commencement and termination of such a period, there would always be a considerable interval, in which the prospect of annihilation would be sufficiently remote, not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of fortitude; and in which he might reasonably promise himself, that there would be time enough before it arrived, to make the community sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"Though it be probable that, as he approached the moment when the public were, by a new election, to signify their sense of his conduct, his confidence, and with it his firmness, would decline; yet both the one and the other would derive support from the opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had afforded him, of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of his constituents.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"He might, then, hazard with safety, in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity, and to the title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his fellow-citizens.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"As, on the one hand, a duration of four years will contribute to the firmness of the Executive in a sufficient degree to render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition; so, on the other, it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public liberty.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If a British House of Commons, from the most feeble beginnings, FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX, have, by rapid strides, reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free government, while they raised themselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the legislature; if they have been able, in one instance, to abolish both the royalty and the aristocracy, and to overturn all the ancient establishments, as well in the Church as State; if they have been able, on a recent occasion, to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an innovation(1) attempted by them, what would be to be feared from an elective magistrate of four years' duration, with the confined authorities of a President of the United States?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"What, but that he might be unequal to the task which the Constitution assigns him?",1,1,0,1,1,0
"I shall only add, that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of his firmness, that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his encroachments.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: THE administration of government, in its largest sense, comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether legislative, executive, or judiciary; but in its most usual, and perhaps its most precise signification.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"it is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application and disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the legislature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the directions of the operations of war--these, and other matters of a like nature, constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the administration of government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The persons, therefore, to whose immediate management these different matters are committed, ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate, and on this account, they ought to derive their offices from his appointment, at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject to his superintendence.",1,1,1,1,1,1
This view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert; and in addition to this propensity, where the alteration has been the result of public choice, the person substituted is warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures; and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"These considerations, and the influence of personal confidences and attachments, would be likely to induce every new President to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations; and these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability in the administration of the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"With a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the circumstance of re-eligibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first is necessary to give to the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well, and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his measures, and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The last is necessary to enable the people, when they see reason to approve of his conduct, to continue him in his station, in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues, and to secure to the government the advantage of permanency in a wise system of administration.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded upon close inspection, than a scheme which in relation to the present point has had some respectable advocates--I mean that of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him from it, either for a limited period or forever after.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"This exclusion, whether temporary or perpetual, would have nearly the same effects, and these effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary.",1,0,0,0,0,0
One ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are few men who would not feel much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must be relinquished at a determinate period, than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining, by meriting, a continuance of them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This position will not be disputed so long as it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest incentives of human conduct; or that the best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their duty.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Even the love of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest minds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit, requiring considerable time to mature and perfect them, if he could flatter himself with the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun, would, on the contrary, deter him from the undertaking, when he foresaw that he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work, and must commit that, together with his own reputation, to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the task.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The most to be expected from the generality of men, in such a situation, is the negative merit of not doing harm, instead of the positive merit of doing good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid views, to peculation, and, in some instances, to usurpation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted, and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory; though the same man, probably, with a different prospect before him, might content himself with the regular perquisites of his situation, and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"An ambitious man, too, when he found himself seated on the summit of his country's honors, when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever, and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse; such a man, in such a situation, would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power, at every personal hazard, than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing his duty.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"Would it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the people like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A third ill effect of the exclusion would be, the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magistrate in the exercise of his office.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"Without supposing the personal essentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief magistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any similar crisis, for another, even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the community, inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience, and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of the administration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"By necessitating a change of men, in the first office of the nation, it would necessitate a mutability of measures.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not generally to be expected, that men will vary and measures remain uniform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The contrary is the usual course of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability, while there is even the option of changing; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they think it may be safely placed, and where, by constancy on their part, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
These are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle of exclusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual exclusion; but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object, the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages?,1,0,0,0,0,0
"They are represented to be: 1st, greater independence in the magistrate; 2d, greater security to the people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unless the exclusion be perpetual, there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"May he not be less willing by a firm conduct, to make personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an inferior, footing?",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is not an easy point to determine whether his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an arrangement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As to the second supposed advantage, there is still greater reason to entertain doubts concerning it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If the exclusion were to be perpetual, a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could be reason in any case to entertain apprehension, would, with infinite reluctance, yield to the necessity of taking his leave forever of a post in which his passion for power and pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good-will of the people, he might induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint upon themselves, a provision which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the people, seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite, might occasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office, by the voluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a constitutional privilege.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the people to continue in office men who had entitled themselves, in their opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of which are at best speculative and equivocal, and are overbalanced by disadvantages far more certain and decisive.",1,0,0,0,0,0

There are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils; and in the main it will be found that a power over a man's support is a power over his will.,1,1,1,1,1,1

"The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the powers, of the other departments, has been already suggested and repeated; the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been remarked upon; and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defense, has been inferred and proved.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive, the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us, that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other, but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of self-defense.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But the power in question has a further use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It not only serves as a shield to the Executive, but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"If it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a favorite choice, when public motives might dictate a different conduct, I answer, that the instances in which the President could be personally interested in the result, would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the Senate.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power(1); that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For I agree, that there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(2) And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Though I trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies,(3) in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"It is evident, it could not be done without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Some well-intentioned men in this State, deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of admiralty, probate, and chancery.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A technical sense has been affixed to the term appellate, which, in our law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of New England.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"In the former, the revision of the law only will be, generally speaking, the proper province of the Supreme Court; in the latter, the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of which prize causes are an example, might be essential to the preservation of the public peace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should, in certain cases, extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a jury, because in the courts of some of the States all causes are tried in this mode(4); and such an exception would preclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper, as where it might be improper.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To avoid all inconveniencies, it will be safest to declare generally, that the Supreme Court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as the national legislature may prescribe.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is this: that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the national judicature; that in the partition of this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the Supreme Court, and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals; that the Supreme Court will possess an appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in all the cases referred to them, both subject to any exceptions and regulations which may be thought advisable; that this appellate jurisdiction does, in no case, abolish the trial by jury; and that an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed judiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which have been predicted from that source.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The principal of these respect the situation of the State courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is this to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction?",0,0,0,0,0,0

"These are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense, and which are certainly entitled to attention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The principles established in a former paper(1) teach us that the States will retain all pre-existing authorities which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases: where an exclusive authority is, in express terms, granted to the Union; or where a particular authority is granted to the Union, and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the States; or where an authority is granted to the Union, with which a similar authority in the States would be utterly incompatible.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power, yet I am inclined to think that they are, in the main, just with respect to the former, as well as the latter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And under this impression, I shall lay it down as a rule, that the State courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The only thing in the proposed Constitution, which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts, is contained in this passage: THE JUDICIAL POWER of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This might either be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courts of the Union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend; or simply to denote, that the organs of the national judiciary should be one Supreme Court, and as many subordinate courts as Congress should think proper to appoint; or in other words, that the United States should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal, and a certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The first excludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the State tribunals; and as the first would amount to an alienation of State power by implication, the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"It is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of, and be peculiar to, the Constitution to be established; for not to allow the State courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases, can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean not therefore to contend that the United States, in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction, may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient; but I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth.",1,0,0,0,0,0

Here another question occurs: What relation would subsist between the national and State courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Wednesday, May 28, 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: THE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most success in this State, and perhaps in several of the other States, is that relative to the want of a constitutional provision for the trial by jury in civil cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The mere silence of the Constitution in regard to civil causes, is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury, and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal, extending not only to every species of civil, but even to criminal causes.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To argue with respect to the latter would, however, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of matter, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which, by their own internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest relations, signified by their signing the deed; could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value?",1,1,1,1,0,0

"Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost all those which are of equity jurisdiction, are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from the whole will be, that this institution, as it exists with us at present, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury; or if there is any difference between them it consists in this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For my own part, the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation, the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high estimation; and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to, as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The strongest argument in its favor is, that it is a security against corruption.",1,0,0,0,0,0

Here then is a double security; and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"There is, however, in all cases, great difficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government, which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other, that difficulty must be not a little augmented.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point; while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent particulars.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence: which is the model that has been followed in several of the States.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law; but it is not a little to be suspected, that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery, on the plan upon which they are established in this State, but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by introducing questions too complicated for a decision in that mode.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For my part, I acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might as advantageously be abridged in others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these States as in Great Britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop, and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain, and it is equally so in the State of Connecticut; and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this State since the Revolution, though provided for by a positive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same time either in Connecticut or Great Britain.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be added that these encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Particular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want of them will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no security for liberty in a Constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because it does not do it in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that Connecticut, which has been always regarded as the most popular State in the Union, can boast of no constitutional provision for either.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been erroneously insinuated with regard to the court of chancery, that this court generally tries disputed facts by a jury.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The truth is, that references to a jury in that court rarely happen, and are in no case necessary but where the validity of a devise of land comes into question.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Wednesday, May 28, 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: IN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken notice of, and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There, however, remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their proper places.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These shall now be discussed; but as the subject has been drawn into great length, I shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Among other answers given to this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the States are in a similar predicament.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I add that New York is of the number.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet the opposers of the new system, in this State, who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things: one is that, though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to the same thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts, in their full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by which many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the convention contains, as well as the constitution of this State, a number of such provisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, we find the following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7--Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Section 9, of the same article, clause 2--The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Clause 3--No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Clause 7--No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Article 3, section 2, clause 3--The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Section 3, of the same article--Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"No person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And clause 3, of the same section--The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this State.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The observations of the judicious Blackstone,(1) in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: To bereave a man of life, (says he) or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place he calls the BULWARK of the British Constitution.",1,1,0,1,1,0
(2) Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the Constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course have no constitutional sanction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the Revolution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the barons, sword in hand, from King John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Such was the Petition of Right assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his reign.",1,1,1,0,1,0
"Such, also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification, they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"WE, THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Here is a better recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our State bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a Constitution like that under consideration, which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If, therefore, the loud clamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this State.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the truth is, that both of them contain all which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever has been said about it in that of any other State, amounts to nothing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"What signifies a declaration, that the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What is the liberty of the press?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I hold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"(3) And here, after all, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights.",1,0,0,0,0,0
There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The several bills of rights in Great Britain form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution of each State is its bill of rights.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the Union.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of the government?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is done in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention; comprehending various precautions for the public security, which are not to be found in any of the State constitutions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are relative to personal and private concerns?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This we have seen has also been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be said that it does not go far enough, though it will not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And hence it must be apparent, that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely foreign from the substance of the thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Another objection which has been made, and which, from the frequency of its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is of this nature: It is improper (say the objectors) to confer such large powers, as are proposed, upon the national government, because the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the conduct of the representative body.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be vested in the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well founded.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the imagination.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What are the sources of information by which the people in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the State legislature?,1,0,0,0,0,0
Of personal observation they can have no benefit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is confined to the citizens on the spot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men, in whom they confide; and how must these men obtain their information?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Evidently from the complexion of public measures, from the public prints, from correspondences with their representatives, and with other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This does not apply to Montgomery County only, but to all the counties at any considerable distance from the seat of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government, and the impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create, will be overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State governments.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The executive and legislative bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every department of the national administration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the national councils, and can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Their disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rivalship of power.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And we may conclude with the fullest assurance that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their national representatives, than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their State representatives.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will, in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with those who are at a distance, and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the Union.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In addition to the remarks I have made upon the subject in another place, I shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law, that States neither lose any of their rights, nor are discharged from any of their obligations, by a change in the form of their civil government.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"(4) The last objection of any consequence, which I at present recollect, turns upon the article of expense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it were even true, that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced, that Union is the basis of their political happiness.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Men of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preserved under the present system, nor without radical alterations; that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that these require a different organization of the federal government--a single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In conceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it is impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The two branches of the legislature are, in the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is the same number of which Congress, under the existing Confederation, may be composed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is true that this number is intended to be increased; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is evident that a less number would, even in the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the present number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a very inadequate representation of the people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One source indicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us examine this a little.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government, are the same which will be required under the new.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are now a Secretary of War, a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a Board of Treasury, consisting of three persons, a Treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These officers are indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well as the old.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries, the proposed Constitution can make no other difference than to render their characters, where they reside, more respectable, and their services more useful.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As to persons to be employed in the collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public expense.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of State for national officers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the collection of all duties, for instance, the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The States individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the State or by the United States?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented to us?,1,0,0,0,0,0
The chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the judges of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do not add the President, because there is now a president of Congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any thing, short of those which will be incurred on account of the President of the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the President.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the Senate, and subject to their final concurrence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future Congress.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The business of the United States has hitherto occupied the State legislatures, as well as Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hence it has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now the members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount to two thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that number.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Congress under the proposed government will do all the business of the United States themselves, without the intervention of the State legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular States, and will not have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This difference in the time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain, and will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It is said that duties may be laid upon the publications so high as to amount to a prohibition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know not by what logic it could be maintained, that the declarations in the State constitutions, in favor of the freedom of the press, would be a constitutional impediment to the imposition of duties upon publications by the State legislatures.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It cannot certainly be pretended that any degree of duties, however low, would be an abridgment of the liberty of the press.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We know that newspapers are taxed in Great Britain, and yet it is notorious that the press nowhere enjoys greater liberty than in that country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if duties of any kind may be laid without a violation of that liberty, it is evident that the extent must depend on legislative discretion, respecting the liberty of the press, will give it no greater security than it will have without them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The same invasions of it may be effected under the State constitutions which contain those declarations through the means of taxation, as under the proposed Constitution, which has nothing of the kind.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"85 Concluding Remarks From MCLEAN's Edition, New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wednesday, May 28, 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York: ACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers, announced in my first number, there would appear still to remain for discussion two points: the analogy of the proposed government to your own State constitution, and the additional security which its adoption will afford to republican government, to liberty, and to property.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work, that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been heretofore said, which the advanced stage of the question, and the time already spent upon it, conspire to forbid.",1,0,0,0,0,0
