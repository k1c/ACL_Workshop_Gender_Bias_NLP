"Imagine walking down the street and seeing advertising screens change their content based on how you walk, how you talk, or even the shape of your chest."
"These screens rely on hidden cameras, microphones and computers to guess if you're male or female."
Women were seeing ads for salad and men were seeing ads for meat options.
"It's worse: Efforts at automatic gender recognition “using algorithms to guess a person's gender based on images, video or audio “ raise significant social and ethical concerns that are not yet fully explored."
Most current research on automatic gender recognition technologies focuses instead on technological details.
"Our recent research found that people with diverse gender identities, including those identifying as transgender or gender nonbinary, are particularly concerned that these systems could miscategorize them."
People who express their gender differently from stereotypical male and female norms already experience discrimination and harm as a result of being miscategorized or misunderstood.
"The idea is that with enough training on abundant user data, algorithms can learn to analyze people's appearance and behavior and perhaps one day characterize people as well as, or even better than, other humans do."
Gender is a hard topic for people to handle.
It's a complex concept with important roles both as a cultural construct and a core aspect of an individual's identity.
"Researchers, scholars and activists are increasingly revealing the diverse, fluid and multifaceted aspects of gender."
"In the process, they find that ignoring this diversity can lead to both harmful experiences and social injustice."
"For example, according to the 2016 National Transgender Survey, 47 percent of transgender participants stated that they had experienced some form of discrimination at their workplace due to their gender identity."
"More than half of transgender people who were harassed, assaulted or expelled because of their gender identity had attempted suicide."
"Many people have, at one time or another, been surprised, or confused or even angered to find themselves mistaken for a person of another gender."
"Effects of automatic gender recognition In our recent research, we interviewed 13 transgender and gender-nonconforming people, about their general impressions of automatic gender recognition technology."
All 13 participants were worried about this technology and doubted whether it could offer their community any benefits.
"Of particular concern was the prospect of being misgendered by it; in their experience, gender is largely an internal, subjective characteristic, not something that is necessarily or entirely expressed outwardly."
"Therefore, neither humans nor algorithms can accurately read gender through physical features, such as the face, body or voice."
They described how being misgendered by algorithms could potentially feel worse than if humans did it.
"Technology is often perceived or believed to be objective and unbiased, so being wrongly categorized by an algorithm would emphasize the misconception that a transgender identity is inauthentic."
But our participants described how the effects of these technologies could be greater for transgender people.
Some participants were even concerned that systems might falsely determine that they are trying to be someone else and deceive the system.
"Their concerns also extended to cisgender people who might look or act differently from the majority, such as people of different races, people the algorithms perceive as androgynous, and people with unique facial structures."
Our interviewees wanted to know more about how automatic gender recognition systems work and what they're used for.
"They didn't want to know deep technical details, but did want to make sure the technology would not compromise their privacy or identity."
"They also wanted more transgender people involved in the early stages of design and development of these systems, well before they are deployed."
Creating inclusive automatic systems
Our research adds to a growing body of work that attempts to more thoughtfully incorporate gender into technology.
We advocate for a more gender-inclusive and human-centric approach to automation that incorporates diverse perspectives.
"But as humans direct that work, they should avoid amplifying human biases and prejudices that are negative and limiting."
"In the case of automatic gender recognition, we do not necessarily conclude that these algorithms should be abandoned."
"Rather, designers of these systems should be inclusive of, and sensitive to, the diversity and complexity of human identity."
Google isn't the only Silicon Valley employer being accused of hostility to white men.
"The Yahoo case began last year when two men sued, claiming they'd been unfairly fired after managers allegedly manipulated performance evaluations to favor women."
"They claim Marissa Mayer approved the review process and was involved in their terminations, and last month a judge ordered the former chief executive be deposed."
"TCS, meanwhile, is fighting three men who claim the Mumbai-based firm discriminates against non-Indians at its U.S.A offices."
"Trump has ordered a review of affirmative action policies in higher education, proposed banning transgender people in the military and advocated curbing immigration of non-English speakers to the delight of conservatives who say they've been muzzled by liberals."
"While gender discrimination complaints aren't uncommon in the tech industry, they are usually made by women, who are outnumbered by nearly 3 to 1."
Ellen Pao put Silicon Valley's Bro Culture front and center in 2015 during a trial pitting her against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
She claimed there was a sexually charged atmosphere where men preyed on their female coworkers and that she'd been blocked from promotion and fired for her gender.
That year Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc. were both sued on behalf of female engineers claiming men are favored for advancement.
"This year, Travis Kalanick was ousted as Uber Technologies Inc. CEO after allegations of rampant sexual harassment at the company."
"Over 10 pages, he complained that efforts at Google to boost diversity were themselves a form of discrimination that are unfair, divisive, and bad for business."
"Women eventually accounted for more than 80 percent of the top management positions in the media division, according to the suit."
"Mayer, who isn't a defendant, couldn't be reached for comment and it isn't clear from court filings whether she's already given her deposition."
"She was CEO from 2012 until June, when Verizon Communications Inc. completed its acquisition of Yahoo's internet assets."
"Verizon's Oath, the unit that includes Yahoo's assets, declined to comment on the Mayer deposition."
The men's attorney didn't respond to requests for comment.
"The case against TCS was filed in 2015 by Steven Heldt, a white U.S.-born IT worker who accused the company of grossly disproportionate favoritism toward hiring people of South Asian descent."
"Heldt, who said he was terminated after about 20 months, claims he experienced substantial anti-American sentiment during his time there."
"TCS calls their claims unfounded, arguing the men haven't proven of a pattern of discrimination, in part because their statistical analysis doesn't properly account for foreign workers legally hired with U.S. work visas."
TCS says their case isn't suited to be a class action based on common allegations for all job seekers because it uses varied hiring methods -- some applicants go directly through the company while others are recruited by outside vendors.
Federal Science Minister Kirsty Duncan has made it clear that gender equity in science is a big priority for her.
27 per cent believe men are favoured in opportunities for leadership roles.
"Scientists at the NRC were one of two groups (the other being a group of researchers spread across many federal departments) flagged by the union as having the lowest representation of women compared to the pool of qualified women in the workforce available to be hired, based on its own analysis from its member database and from government science hiring competitions."
"The analysis also found ""a diminishing proportion of women to men"" occupying higher-level positions in science departments."
"The analysis is part of a report about gender bias that also includes results from the voluntary survey, conducted online by Environics Research between May 29 and June 27, 2017."
"It included not only questions related to gender, but other issues such as whether they feel they can speak freely about their work."
"More than half of federal government scientists still feel muzzled, poll findsSusan O'Donnell, a member of the PIPSC science advisory committee and lead author of the PIPSC report, said the union is delighted the minister has asked for further research."
Diversity and excellence Gender equity is something.
"As a former scientist who happens to be a woman, it was not always easy, and I spent 25 years fighting for diversity in research."
"Last year, she wrote an opinion piece about her experiences, including being paid in the bottom 10th percentile at her university and being told it was because she was a woman."
We know that diversity and research excellence go hand in hand.
"She gave several examples where male-dominated research has let women down, such as voice-recognition software calibrated to male voices, early airbags designed for men that injured women and children, and the first artificial heart valves, designed to fit a male-sized heart."
She also cited stories she didn't expect to hear about  the negative experiences that women are still having in science.
"A lot of young would women would come up and cry in my arms, no exaggeration."
"""Are women progressing through the ranks at the same rate as male colleagues or Indigenous people or people from minority backgrounds or persons with disabilities, and are they making equal pay""?"
Women made up 58 per cent of 24 recipients of the Canada 150 Research Chairs announced in March.
"The program aims to attract researchers from abroad with offers of either $350,000 or $1 million a year for seven years."
She comes on too strong.
Her male counterpart?
"He needs to learn to be a little more patient, but who doesn't?"
"I don't know whether Jessica got her promotion, but the exchange got me wondering how often this perception of female abrasiveness undermines women's careers in technology."
I asked men and women in tech if they would be willing to share their reviews for a study and didn't stipulate anything else.
I figured only strong performers would be willing to share and was most interested in looking at the critical feedback that these strong performers had received.
The question I wanted to answer was: Did review tone or content differed based on the employee's gender?
I also wanted to know whether the manager's gender was a factor in how they reviewed their employees.
I was especially interested in employees who shared reviews given by both male and female managers.
"In all, I collected 248 reviews from 180 people, 105 men and 75 women."
Women's reviews are more likely to include critical feedback.
"105 men submitted 141 reviews, and 75 women submitted 107 reviews."
"However, critical feedback was not distributed evenly by gender."
"When breaking the reviews down by gender of the person evaluated, 58.9% of the reviews received by men contained critical feedback."
Men are given constructive suggestions whereas women are given constructive suggestions and told to pipe down.
"In the 177 reviews where people receive critical feedback, men and women receive different kinds."
The critical feedback men receive is heavily geared towards suggestions for additional skills to develop.
A few examples: Constructive feedback on your performance as a feature crew tester can be summed up by saying that you still have some skills to continue to develop.
Hone your strategies for guiding your team and developing their skills.
There were a few cases where it would have been extremely helpful if you had gone deeper into the details to help move an area forward.
"Women receive this kind of constructive feedback too but the women's reviews include another, sharper element that is absent from the men's."
She can come across as abrasive sometimes.
Her peers sometimes feel that you don't leave them enough room.
Sometimes she needs to step back to let others shine.
"I did find some gender effects in the writing, for instance, the reviews written by women average almost 50% longer than those written by men, but none relevant to this study."
"Female managers account for just over 23% of the negative critical feedback written in the reviews, which is close to what you'd expect given that they wrote 25% of the reviews to begin with."
There's a common perception that women in technology endure personality feedback that their male peers just don't receive.
"Words like bossy, abrasive, strident, and aggressive are used to describe women's behaviors when they lead; words like emotional and irrational describe their behaviors when they object."
"All of these words show up at least twice in the women's review text I reviewed, some much more often."
Abrasive alone is used 17 times to describe 13 different women.
"I don't know whether women were simply more willing to submit reviews that include critical language, or whether men removed language from their review documents before submitting."
"At most mid-size or large tech companies, HR leaders supervise review scores to uncover and correct patterns of systematic bias."
"One of Silicon Valley's most famous venture capital firms prevailed on Friday over a former partner in a closely watched suit claiming gender discrimination, but hardly got away unscathed."
"The plaintiff, Ellen Pao, had accused the firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, of discriminating against her in the course of her employment and eventual dismissal."
The decision handed Kleiner a sweeping victory in a case that had mesmerized Silicon Valley with its salacious details while simultaneously amplifying concerns about the lack of diversity in the technology industry.
"Even with her loss in the case, Ms. Pao's suit succeeded in prompting debate about women in technology and venture capital, said Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University."
Should birth sex trump declared gender in prison?
Should prisoner placement be based on biological sex rather than identified gender?
"When a transgender inmate enters prison housing, should they be housed according to their biological sex, or the gender by which they identify?"
"According to Obama-era legislation, prison housing, like the use of public restrooms, should be determined by a person's identified gender."
But President Donald Trump is on a roll to reverse a number of his predecessors legislative decisions says otherwise.
"According to a recent announcement by the U.S. Bureau of prisons, an inmate's biological sex will now be used to determine where transgender prisoners are housed."
"Because four women being held at a Texas detention center have filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the Obama decision (introduced just days before the 44th president left office) leaves them at greater risk of rape, because they might have to share facilities with transgender women."
"Those who support Trump's reversal ”who believe prisoners should be separated by biological sex” argue that prison is just a tough place full of tough people, and that the nuances of human sexuality are increasingly difficult to navigate within its walls."
"Some point to the same argument that has been used to oppose trans people from using the bathrooms that coincide with their identities that is, who can say for sure that a twisted fox isn't trying to get into the henhouse?"
"Prison blues Others argue this is just the latest blow to transgender rights and understanding, and simply highlights the administration's willingness to put the safety of non-trans prisoners above that of transgender individuals."
"Reports indicate that transgender prisoners are some of the most likely to face physical, emotional and sexual abuse in prison, leading some to argue that rolling back the pre-existing protections for trans prisoners in this way doesn't do anything to improve the safety of prison systems overall, but merely shifts the danger from one group of people to another."
"A 2016 report from the Movement Advancement Project and the Center for American Progress reported that compared to the 1.2 percent of heterosexual inmates report sexual assault by other inmates in prison and jails, 24.1 percent of trans inmates report at least one sexual assault."
"Underlying the discussion is the Trump administration's vocal opposition to transgender rights, including its recent attempt to ban transgender people from serving in the military."
Transgender (adjective): denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.
Transvestite (noun): a person who derives pleasure from dressing in clothes usually associated with the opposite sex.
Transsexual (noun): a person who strongly identifies with the opposite gender so much so that they seek medical/surgical intervention to attain the physical characteristics of that opposite gender.
By gender identification or by biological identification?
"In 2013, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimated there were 700,000 transgender adults in the United States."
"That transgender community has been in the news a lot lately, due largely to recent government action."
"On May 12, Mr. Trump reversed yet another one of his predecessor's actions, decreeing that now an inmate's biological sex will be used to make the initial decision as to where transgender prisoners are housed, instead of the gender by which they identify."
"To make a determination about placement, a Transgender Executive Council can consider the inmate's health and safety, the inmate's history of behavior, and the security of the institution and its inmates."
"According to the revisions, an inmate may also be assigned to a facility based on their self-identified gender if there has been significant progress towards transition as demonstrated by medical and mental health history."
Prison wardens are permitted to recommend transferring an inmate based on their identified gender as well.
"The reversal came about in part because Donald Trump seems bent upon undoing everything Barak Obama did, just because it was Obama who did it and in part due to a lawsuit brought by four female Texas prison inmates."
"These women contend the previous prison guidelines, which allowed transgenders to be placed according to their gender identity, put them at greater risk of rape because they might have to share facilities with transgender women."
"Following the changes made on the twelfth, prison authorities are now instructed to consider the health and safety of transgender inmates, as well as whether placement would threaten the management and security of the institution and/or pose a risk to other inmates in the institution."
"Following up, Nancy Ayers, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisoners, said the new policy views the needs of all federal prisoners and articulates the balance of safety needs of transgender inmates as well as other inmates?."
A study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows 4% of federal and state prison inmates have been assaulted by either fellow inmates or by staff.
"For their own safety, transgender as well as homosexual prisoners are sometimes placed in administrative segregation or protective custody."
"For the greater good and safety of the majority of prisoners, it is untenable to retain male prisoners who claim to be transgender within women's correctional facilities."
The same is true for transgender females who want to be incarcerated in men's prisons.
"In our multi-cultural, gender-altering society, it's somewhat surprising that the issue of this week's debate would cause the angst that it apparently has stirred up."
"The question: where should a transgender prisoner be housed; with their biological matching comrades-in-crime, or with the prisoners with whom they gender identify?"
Are transgenders more vulnerable to attacks while incarcerated?
There is statistical evidence that suggests that transgender women (biological males transitioning into females) face increased threats of violence while incarcerated.
"According to one survey conducted by the Transgender Law Center, 67% of transgender prisoners in the California correctional system report to having being assaulted while in men's prison."
The vulnerability of LGBT prisoners has led some prisons to separate them from other prisoners.
"Statistically, these inmates are more likely to be assaulted both physically and sexually."
They are more likely to be forced into prostitution when living in a male prison population.
Prison protocol for assigning one to prison for many years was based upon the inmate's biological gender.
If you had a man's genitals you were assigned to a men's prison.
"If you shared the biological genitals of a woman, then it was a woman's prison for you."
"That policy was changed by President Obama in the last days of his administration, when prison administrations were ordered to allow transgender women to be placed in women's prisons."
That fix was not a hit in at least some of the women's prisons where women inmates were not happy about being housed in a prison with biological men no matter how they choose to identify themselves.
"In fact, four women being held at a Texas detention center are not at all happy with that Obama policy."
"They have filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the Obama decision is dangerous to them, leaving them at greater risk of rape if they are forced to share facilities with transgender women."
The U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced a new policy stating that an inmate's biological sex will now be used to determine where transgender prisoners are housed.
This new policy has angered the LGBT community.
The classic problem here is the rights of one group (transgender inmates) coming directly into conflict with the rights of a second group (women inmates).
"Expressing the opinion that as a woman, living in a cell block with a biological man makes them fearful for their safety, does not make them unreasonable or unsympathetic."
Both groups of inmates want to feel safe during their prison stay.
"While they may be in transition from being a man to becoming a woman, until they undergo surgical modification, transgender women are seen, rightly or wrongly it doesn.t matter, as a threat by some women."
"Despite the all-inclusive message of the Netflix series Orange is the New Black to the contrary, transgender women in prison are perceived as threats to non-trans women."
"Frankly, the civil rights of one group should not override the civil rights of another group."
There is a compromise that should be able to work without affecting the rights of either group.
Throughout the prison system there are populations of segregated prisoners within the same institution.
That's not to say that there aren't times when the rival gangs find ways to mix it up.
"If prison authority can segregate these violent gangs, then they should be required to protect transgender women by segregating them within men's prisons."
"It's not a perfect solution, but it addresses the violence against this population without endangering and violating the rights of others."
"If you are not transgender, you have as little to offer on what it's like to be transgender as I do."
"If you aren't either, then we are equally unqualified to make factual assertions about the transgender paradigm."
"Therefore, moving forward as empathetic and moral human beings, it is critical that those of us in those categories make the following concession: When it comes to trans issues, we are not born knowing or understanding them, and our average daily existence doesn't provide the necessary experience for us to know what the f**k we're talking about."
Our current administration's decision to void provisions for members of the transgendered community to be housed in a facility that corresponds to their current gender identification is not some form of tough but fair administrative judgment call.
"It's a conscious choice not to care about the flagrantly available statistics, modern scientific thought, and reality in general."
So here are the facts that the current administration doesn.t care about: medical and psychological science views transgenderism as a real condition that is of foundational importance to a person's identity and dignity.
"The ability to provide services for the transgender community offers an overwhelming benefit for their quality of life, and one that is uniquely personal."
"In other words, this is about who I am,not who I like to pretend to be."
"Furthermore, the facts of life in prison for someone who is transgender are far more bleak than the average inmate's."
"If you are using hormone replacement therapy and living as your non-biological gender, it is an interruption of the continuity of your humanity to be told you are going to have to get by without it because you are in prison."
"There is no condition in which a non-transgendered man or woman would be told that, for their stay in Club Fed, they are going to have to be a different gender."
"Similarly, we would never tell a person that a stay in prison was going to delay splinting a broken arm or cost them access to insulin, and we can come to this conclusion with the most placid simplicity of thought."
Transgendered people also face extremely high rates of sexual abuse in prison relative to the rest of the population.
The following example provides anyone with a reasonable mind enough to know what it might be like: current policy provides that a person born as a man but living and grooming themselves as a woman who has breast implants would be housed in the general population of a male prison with a cellmate.
There was a headline-making case about a transgendered inmate this very month in a Colorado men's prison.
The prison experience made Andy Dufresne's first year in Shawshank look like Megan and Prince Harry's wedding album.
"After several rapes and beatings, the final sexual assault left her in the infirmary hours after a judge denied her request to be transferred to a safer situation."
"Transgendered inmates, whether in male or female facilities, are overwhelmingly on the abused side of the equation."
Men living as women do not show up in female prison facilities and take over the place as if Roger Federer took a lap on the WTA tour.
"The cost to our prison facilities is minimal, as are the arrangements necessary for accommodating clothing such as bras, sanitary products and any treatment continuity that predates incarceration."
"In an age marred by very real fears of violence and hate, the idea that someone should be treated with respect and dignity is becoming somewhat of a radical, fringe idea."
"We can preserve the dignity and safety of transgender inmates, and it is our responsibility as a people who believe in the rule of law and value of our common humanity."
"Equality for all; Transgender prisoners have rights, too"
"To be equal no longer means regardless of our differences but rather to be forced into the mold of the angry, white, straight, and currently-in-power minority."
"And while we can debate the role of the government in defining what is right, we cannot discount the role of that body to enforce and promote equality among its citizenry."
"But what the shaved head-bearing, gun-toting, loud-mouthed members of middle America seem to forget is that equality does not mean everyone is the same as you."
It means that everyone is given the same chance and treatment in life.
Prisoners are allotted rights that do not infringe on their basic human condition and guarantee them the same conditions and treatment as every other inmate regardless of any conditions.
The rollback of these rules blatantly breaks this notion and creates a culture of uncertainty that can be taken advantage of on every level of both the criminal justice system and the underground prison society and leave the most vulnerable inmates defenseless.
"Additionally, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to prison inmates, protecting them against unequal treatment on the basis of race, sex, and creed, and the Model Sentencing and Correction Act, created by the Uniform Law Commission in 1978, provides that a confined person has a protected interest in freedom from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation."
"Put shortly, it is against the Constitution to provide one prisoner with a different condition than that of a comparable prisoner."
"To place an individual, a person (and we must remember that just because someone is incarcerated does not mean they are no longer a person), in conditions that are against their identified gender directly contradicts the principles of the Constitution of the United States."
"Not only is the refusal to treat transgender prisoners in a respectful and acceptable way illegal, it is dangerous."
"As the National Center for Transgender Equality puts it, Trans people are also at high risk for abuse in prisons, jails, and juvenile detention."
"The categorical denial of transition-related medical care is common, as is prolonged isolation of trans people, which has been shown to have devastating effects on mental health and has been declared by the courts to be a type of torture."
Even more disturbing are some numbers about trans incarceration.
"According to the New York Anti-Violence Project, 16% of the transgender and gender non-conforming people have been sent to jail or prison for any reason"
"Not only are these individuals jailed at a substantially higher rate than the general population, but they are at a higher risk of violent or sexual abuse during their incarceration."
"To be blunt, all evidence points to this very specific segment of the prison population needing very specific regulations and often, protections."
"In short, it does two things, adds to the list of Obama-era rules that the current administration has undone, and takes away explicit rights and protections for a group of people that are not straight, white, or average."
The animosity that an act such as removing these protections comes with is beyond comparison and those who support it need to re-evaluate their ethics and morals.
"Every man, woman, child, and everything in between in this county is guaranteed fair treatment by everyone, including the prison system, and to remove protections that enforce that shows the type of America that we are currently living in."
"If you want to do something about this, donate to the ACLU or even better, get out and vote and let's ensure a future where all people are protected from abuse regardless of gender identity."
Albertans have a new option when in comes to identifying their gender on provincial documents and identification.
"An X has been added to the gender choices of M and F , male or female, on driver's licences, identification cards and vital statistics records such as birth and death certificates."
"Premier Rachel Notley was on hand for Friday's announcement at the Strathcona Registry, which was decked out in rainbow colours for the event."
"""We look forward to being able to work with Albertans to have their ID reflect their own sense of who they are""."
The new gender option is available for Albertans of all ages.
"Adults can simply request a change, while youths aged 12 to 18 can have their gender identifier changed as long as they have parental consent."
"For children under age 12, the X option is also available."
Someone who is described in their performance evaluations as analytical or someone who is described as compassionate?
Someone perceived as arrogant or someone perceived as inept?
Leadership attributions in performance evaluations are powerful.
"A unique and fascinating data set allowed us to explore the language used to describe individuals in subjective performance evaluations and provides evidence that, as we suspected, language in performance evaluations is applied differently to describe men and women."
"We analyzed a large-scale military dataset (over 4,000 participants and 81,000 evaluations) to examine objective and subjective performance measures that included a list of 89 positive and negative leadership attributes that were used to assess leader performance in a military leadership setting."
"The military provides an interesting and significant setting to evaluate gender bias as it is a long-standing and traditionally male profession that has, over several decades, worked to eliminate formal gender segregation and discrimination."
"The top-down enforcement of equal employment opportunity policies, hierarchical organization by military rank and not social status characteristics, and recent total gender integration in all occupations are hallmarks of meritocratic organizations where we might expect less gender bias in performance evaluations."
"For starters, in terms of sheer numbers of attributes, we found no gender difference in the number of positive attributes assigned, but women were assigned significantly more negative attributes."
We also looked at which specific attributes were more often assigned to men and to women.
This gives us a better idea of how gendered language is employed in leader evaluations.
"The most commonly used positive term to describe men was analytical, while for women it was compassionate."
"At the other extreme, the most commonly used negative term to describe men was arrogant."
We found statistically significant gender differences in how often these terms (and others) were used (relative to the other positive or negative terms available for selection) when describing men and women even though men's and women's performances were the same by more objective measures.
Both analytical and compassionate reflect positively on the individual being evaluated.
"However, could one characterization be more valuable from an organizational standpoint?"
"The term analytical is task-oriented, speaking to an individual's ability to reason, to interpret, to strategize, and lending support to the objectives or mission of the business."
"Compassion is relationship-oriented, contributing to a positive work environment and culture, but perhaps of less value to accomplishing the work at hand."
An arrogant employee may have a character flaw and a negative impact on his work environment but may still be able to accomplish the task or job.
"An inept person, in contrast, is clearly not qualified and presumably on her way out."
Our research on leadership attributes found significant differences in the assignment of 28 leadership attributes when applied to men and women.
"While men were more often assigned attributes such as analytical, competent, athletic and dependable, women were more often assigned compassionate, enthusiastic, energetic and organized."
"Consistent with our results, societal attitudes suggest that women leaders are described as more compassionate (the most assigned attribute overall) and organized than men leaders."
"In contrast, women were more often evaluated as inept, frivolous, gossip, excitable, scattered, temperamental, panicky, and indecisive, while men were more often evaluated as arrogant and irresponsible."
Our research is in line with other studies that have found differences in formal feedback for men and women.
"Some studies have shown that women are more likely to receive vague feedback that is not connected to objectives or business outcomes, which is a disadvantage when women are competing for job opportunities, promotions, and rewards, and in terms of womenâ€™s professional growth and identity."
"Women leaders often get conflicting feedback told on the one hand that they're too bossy or aggressive, but on the other that they should be more confident and assertive."
"A huge body of work has found that when women are collaborative and communal, they are not perceived as competent but when they emphasize their competence, they're seen as cold and unlikable, in a classic double bind?."
"One of the things that's ironic about our findings is that many of the leadership traits that people say they most appreciate, want in a leader, or make a successful leader are the positive traits such as compassion that women leaders receive in their performance evaluations."
So why isn't this translating into more women in these roles?
"It's one thing to describe an ideal leader, it's another to describe a real person's performance without being influenced by stereotypes about their gender, or stereotypes about what a leader should be."
"Because of widely held societal beliefs about gender roles and leadership, when most people are asked to picture a leader, what they picture is a male leader."
"Even when women and men behave in leaderly ways among peers speaking up with new ideas, for example it's men who are seen as leaders by the group, not women."
"As our study shows, even in this era of talent management and diversity and inclusion initiatives, our formal feedback mechanisms are still suffering from the same biases, sending subtle messages to women that they aren't real leaders men are."
"Even when they have Harvard MBAs, black women are generally absent in leadership positions at most Fortune 500 companies, and black men are in high-ranking roles in only a handful."
Researchers who have examined black women in corporate settings generally highlight their unique experiences not just as black workers but as black women workers.
"Dealing with racism and sexism means that black women in these settings face particular challenges at work, from difficulty finding mentors and sponsors to extra scrutiny of their hair and other aspects of their appearance."
These are important findings that give some insight into how race and gender operate together to yield specific outcomes for black women.
But they only reveal part of the picture for black workers.
"Black men, of course, are also present in professional work."
How are their experiences in these settings driven by race and gender — and how do they differ from the experiences black men have in other types of occupations?
"In white male–dominated professions like law, engineering, or medicine, black men are in the majority because of their gender, but in the minority due to their race."
It’s not quite the token experience that Rosabeth Moss Kanter describes in her classic study of women working in male-dominated spaces.
"Those women, mostly white, were constantly reminded of the ways they stood out, faced a paradox of visibility and invisibility, and were relegated to gender-typed positions as secretaries or wives even when they were high-ranking executives."
Black men’s experiences in these types of environments are a bit more complicated.
Two of my recent research studies touch on the ways that black professional men navigate predominantly white work settings.
"In one, I conducted intensive interviews with 42 black men working in high-status occupations — doctors, lawyers, engineers, and bankers."
I found that these men’s relationships with other men in their workplaces were informed by gender and race in unique ways.
"For one thing, most of my respondents described largely amiable relationships with their white male coworkers."
"Unlike women of all races, who have to walk a fine line in male-dominated professions — for example, being friendly without seeming sexual, being assertive without coming across as aggressive — black men could fairly easily capitalize on culturally masculinized interests and activities to forge a bond with their white male colleagues."
"This experience reflects research from sociologist Catherine Turco, who shows that for black men in the leveraged buyout industry in particular, sports are a key way to bond with white men in ways that are often unavailable to women."
"For many black men in these settings, gender is something they are able to capitalize on so that white men can become friends, colleagues, and peers."
"As Max, an engineer, put it, If you’re male and African American, you don’t have the double bias [that women face]."
"You’re a minority, but you can befriend the other male colleagues."
"And maybe they won’t like you, but there are enough senior male colleagues that one of them will like you, and you can get the information you need."
"So it’s much different for a female…than an African American male, because I’m a male, and a lot of the restrictions that male colleagues will put on their interactions with females in the department don’t exist for me."
But race matters for black men in these settings too.
"While they can capitalize on shared gendered experiences to bond with white men, who can serve in important roles as allies, sponsors, and mentors, they describe a sense of alienation and isolation on the job."
"This comes from the fact that fitting in with white colleagues has its limits, and from the sense that only other black men can really understand the challenges associated with being black and male in these spaces — the persistent negative stereotyping, the complicated dance of managing interactions with white women to avoid appearing threatening, the need to avoid ever being perceived as the “angry black man”."
"Yet with so few other black professional men being in these spaces, opportunities to bond and form allegiances are often infrequent."
"And even in the rare cases when other black men work in the office, gendered conditioning tends to encourage men to be stoic and independent."
This means that many black men don’t feel equipped to reach out to other black men to develop meaningful friendships because “that’s what women do”.
"In the words of Jared, a lawyer, “When it comes to women in a large law firm, I would imagine they would be closer."
"Because I just feel like [with] men and the experiences that I’ve had with men in this profession, we’re not really about all crying on each other’s shoulders."
"Although we are here to help out if we can, or to bounce ideas off of, I don’t know if we’re necessarily as close as maybe women are”."
"Still, the types relationships that black men have with other men can be drastically different depending on their occupation."
"In a forthcoming book on black workers in the health care industry, I show that while black men working in the male-dominated field of medicine find it much easier to connect with white colleagues, black men working in the female-dominated profession of nursing face extensive barriers in their attempts to forge ties with the white men they encounter at work."
"They struggled to bond with white men, who rarely seemed interested in connecting and often stymied their efforts to advance."
"As Curtis, an orthopedic nurse, told me, “It’s almost like you have to take your ideas and give them to somebody else, and let them present for you, and you get no credit for it”."
"Sociologist Christine Williams has shown that for white men, work in female-dominated professions can actually provide more opportunities for advancement."
"Given that, it may be that white male nurses try to maintain their racial and gendered advantages, and actively exclude black men from opportunities to advance."
"If so, this opportunity hoarding is compounded by the fact that black male nurses rarely encountered other black male colleagues who might sympathize, making the sense of isolation even more acute."
"Here, race and gender created experiences among black men that are more akin to the “chilly climate” that many women experience in STEM fields as they confront harassment and hostility from colleagues that leads to systemic disadvantage."
"Because working in the female-dominated profession of nursing left black men in the minority due to both their race and gender, it may have created workplaces where they saw fewer allies and pathways to advancement than their counterparts in male-dominated fields."
"Taken together, the experiences of black men in different occupations shows that context matters."
"In many ways, they are “outsiders within” in corporate America, and the particulars reflect their unique position of race and gender."
"This leaves them with workplace relationships and general experiences that differ starkly from those of other numerical minorities, particularly women, but also from black men in female-dominated professions."
"Because of this, it’s important for managers to be mindful of the ways that black professionals’ work experiences can vary widely, and that one-size-fits-all attempts to increase workplace diversity and to reduce racial tensions may be met with limited success."
Many of her girlfriends worked toward the same goal.
But her younger brother and most of her male friends seemed more inclined to act like Falstaff than to study Shakespeare.
"""A lot of guys thought studying was for girls,"" says DeLong, now a junior French major at the University of Georgia in Athens."
"""They were really intelligent, but they would goof off, and it seemed to be accepted by the teachers""."
"Take DeLong's experience, multiply it a few thousand times in schools across the state, and it isn't surprising that at her campus this year, the freshman class is nearly 61% female."
"In a freshman English tutorial, small clusters of men sit quietly as women dominate class discussions."
"But outside class, the mood on campus is distinctly male friendly."
"Tyler Willingham, social chair of the Sigma Nu fraternity, observes that at parties, even guys without dates can choose from ""many beautiful women""."
This sort of gender gap is glaring and growing at campuses across America.
"Until 1979, men made up the majority of college students."
"As women won increasing equality elsewhere in society, it was natural and expected that they would reach parity in college, which they did by the early 1980s."
But the surprise has been that men's enrollment in higher education has declined since 1992.
Males now make up just 44% of undergraduate students nationwide.
And federal projections show their share shrinking to as little as 42% by 2010.
This trend is among the hottest topics of debate among college-admissions officers.
And some private liberal arts colleges have quietly begun special efforts to recruit men — including admissions preferences for them.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that more men than women respond to the lure of high-tech jobs that don't require a bachelor's degree.
"Some call this the Bill Gates syndrome, after the college-dropout chairman of Microsoft."
"Amid the hot economy of recent years, a larger group of men — especially those from lower-income families — might be heading straight from high school into fields like aircraft mechanics and telephone- and power-line repair that pay an average of $850 a week rather than taking on a load of college debt."
"Some social critics blame a dearth of male role models among schoolteachers, and a culture that promotes anti-intellectualism among boys."
"And, especially in inner cities, crime and gangs entice more boys than girls away from learning."
How pervasive is the gender gap?
"According to Thomas Mortenson, an education analyst in Oskaloosa, Iowa, the share of college degrees earned by males has been declining for decades."
"U.S. government figures show that from 1970 to 1996, as the number of bachelor's degrees earned by women increased 77%, the number earned by men rose 19%."
Not all schools are feeling the imbalance; many élite colleges and universities have seen applications soar from both sexes.
"But the overall numbers, says Mortenson, should make us ""wake up and see that boys are in trouble""."
"Jacqueline King, author of a recent study on the gender gap in college, emphasizes that it is widest among blacks (63% women to 37% men in the latest figures), Hispanics (57% to 43%) and, in her analysis, lower-income whites (54% to 46%)."
"""It's not middle-class white young men who aren't going to college,"" she says."
And an enrollment boom among older women is further skewing the numbers.
"Moreover, he and others argue, boys as a group trail girls at many stages of K-12 achievement: boys tend to earn lower grades and are less likely to earn a high school diploma."
"They score marginally higher on the SAT, but only 65% of boys who apply are admitted to college, vs. 69% of girls."
"Christina Hoff Sommers, a conservative education analyst, writes in her recent book, The War Against Boys, that schoolboys are ""routinely regarded as protosexists, potential harassers and perpetuators of gender inequity"" who ""live under a cloud of censure""."
"Sommers cites studies showing that boys come to school less prepared than girls, do less homework and get suspended more often."
"""For males, there's no social currency in being a straight-A student,"" says Clifford Thornton, associate dean of admissions at Wesleyan University."
"Although the latest figures show that college graduates earn, on average, almost double the wages of those with no college, ""there's a sense among many boys that it's sissy to go to college,"" says sociologist and author Michael Kimmel."
"After high school he took classes at a community college before quitting to work in his father's cabinet shop in Royston, Ga."
"Today Spagnoli, 25, earns $50,000 a year, while his buddies are just finishing college, taking jobs for lower pay."
"""You don't need a degree"" he says, if you have a talent."
Some private liberal arts colleges are making it easier for men to get in.
"This year's freshman class is 43% male — up from 36% last year — in part because the school gave preference to ""qualified male candidates on the margin,"" says Robert Massa, vice president for enrollment and student life."
The idea gets mixed reviews among Dickinson's students.
"""It reeks of affirmative action,"" says physics major Michelle Edwards."
"But Massa emphasizes that ""the men we admitted were as qualified as the women""."
Last July the University of Georgia lost a lawsuit filed by female students who were denied admission because of an affirmative-action policy that favored men.
"Says junior Shanna Norris, 20: ""It's not fair that a boy would get extra weight (in the admissions index) over a girl, but it would be better if there were more boys on campus""."
How then to recruit more guys?
"At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recruiters aggressively tout math and science programs — traditionally popular among male applicants."
Chicago's DePaul University (59% female) sends out extra mailings to boys.
"Public universities, though, could face legal challenges if they were to try recruiting more males."
In California a strict anti-affirmative-action statute effectively precludes gender-based outreach.
In Texas and Florida — both of which have largely abolished preferences in admissions policies — state officials say there are no special plans to lure more men.
Many schools still try to balance programs historically dominated by one gender (like engineering and social work) by offering slots to underrepresented students.
"But that doesn't necessarily boost, say, the number of Hispanic males."
And that has led some educators to skirt the recruiting rules.
"At San Francisco State University, Roberto Haro, a professor of ethnic studies, routinely recruits minority males at Boys Clubs and middle schools in inner-city areas."
"As a result, he says, ""in the past year, we've seen a slight increase in the number of minority males who have applied""."
He is the typical frat-boy
"In Maryland the Howard County alumni chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha runs a mentoring program for high school males, helping boost their grades and inspiring them to apply to college."
"Says program head David Barrett: ""So many of our boys are in prison."
"And surely more men will also be lured onto campuses by the realization that they'll be surrounded by smart, attractive women with great earnings prospects."
"Jo Swinson is a British member of parliament, deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats and author of Equal Power."
"The new Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, has shown leaders around the world something simple, but striking: you can have more women than men in your cabinet without the country falling apart."
"What is even more remarkable is that so many of the biggest jobs in the Spanish cabinet, including economy, defense, finance and education, went to women."
"As a member of parliament (MP) in the U.K., a country where we are yet to have a woman serve as head of the treasury or defense secretary, I applaud Mr Sanchez."
"As a seasoned campaigner for gender-balanced representation in both the U.K. and Scottish Parliaments, I am delighted with this news—as I was also in 2014 when Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet, three years ago when Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his gender-balanced top team (“because it’s 2015”) and last year when President Emmanuel Macron of France did the same."
"It will show to the rest that women can fit comfortably into any environment, that all the “good” women haven’t been “snapped up,” that women can handle the pressure."
These were just some of the pathetic excuses given by FTSE 350 businesses to a government-backed review to explain why they didn’t have more women on their boards.
"But, part of me also wishes that we lived in a world where appointing as many or more women to a government was the norm, not the news."
It wasn’t until 2017 that the total number of women MPs ever elected to the House of Commons finally overtook the number of men currently serving as MPs.
"In local government, just a third of councillors in England are women, with even fewer in Wales (28%) and Scotland (24%)."
"In the U.S., Donald Trump’s current cabinet women hold six of the 23 positions."
So what’s stopping there being more women at the top?
"The most commonly cited barriers are known as the four Cs: cash, caring, confidence and culture."
"This affects men as well as women, but when men earn 19% more than women on average in the U.K., the financial barrier to politics is even higher for women."
"There is also the question of family commitments, and balancing care with the demands of politics."
"Across society, the lion’s share of caring responsibility—whether for children or elderly relatives—still falls on women."
"The pattern among colleagues in my party is that women were typically either elected young, like myself, with no children, or when their children were teenagers or had left home."
"This was not the case for men, many of whom were first elected when their children were very young."
"In the current political system, in the U.K. and U.S., you have to put your head above the parapet and be prepared to make your point forcefully."
We often tell women and girls it is not OK to blow their own trumpet in that way.
As a society we still tell girls how to be feminine and ladylike.
"Male-dominated workplaces, including the top levels of politics in much of the Western world, makes women feel uncomfortable in other ways too."
"This is something the MeToo movement highlighted, including in the U.K. parliament and among lawmakers in the U.S. While my party was in government, one ministerial colleague told me she would always ensure she was seated on the opposite side of the table when having a meeting with a particularly tactile minister."
"Much of political decision-making concentrates power in the hands of those already inside the circle, who tend to be men."
"Excluding women may not be the intention, but when they are not invited into the room where decisions are made, you can see how it happens."
That is why it is so important that men who have the opportunity to open these doors to more women take it.
"Even in places where female representation is more balanced, there are still parts of power closed to women."
"One example I heard was from Finland, where the current cabinet is 41% women (in 2015 the split stood at 62% women)."
Former Finnish parliamentarian Johanna Sumuvuori told me the Finnish Parliament has separate saunas for male and female MPs and staff.
"Johanna explained how her male colleagues on the Finance Committee would joke that they’d already made all the decisions in the men’s sauna before they arrived to the meeting, dubbed the “Sauna Committee”."
"Getting more women into positions of power will change this, and make governments more representative of the populations they serve."
"But if, like me, you want us to move faster toward gender-balanced governments and parliaments, here are three simple things you can do."
"Notice the number of men and women standing as candidates, becoming elected representatives, speaking at events, the split of journalist bylines in newspapers—and challenge parties, organizers or media outlets when they are not representative."
"Second, talent-spot our next women politicians."
There are campaigns across the globe to help more women get into politics.
"In the U.K., there’s the AskHerToStand campaign, and in the U.S. there’s She Should Run; both offer advice to potential candidates and how you can encourage women you know—friends, family and colleagues—to consider standing for election."
"But unless we see more systemic change, I worry that in a decade’s time we’ll still have news reports on the gender makeup of a new government."
"Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture."
So how are you even supposed to meet people?
No one wants to watch a couple meet multiple times and slowly realize that they’re more than friends.
"In real life, hitting on strangers doesn’t usually get you anywhere."
The golden rule of all attempted romantic encounters is: Take “no” for an answer.
"Again, these places might seem ripe for meet-cutes in movies (the juxtaposition of romantic moment and unromantic location! ), but in the real world they’re places where women are usually alone."
"This dynamic probably makes you, the approacher, feel less threatened, but it makes her, the approached, feel like she’s in the kitchen in Jurassic Park with velociraptors scraping at the door handles."
"If she keeps going about her business even as you try to approach her, that’s a great sign that (surprise! ) she is not interested."
Let her carry on with her day.
"Likewise, if she’s giving you short, one-word answers and doesn’t ask you any questions about yourself, that’s also a pretty good sign that she’s not interested."
Say you’re shopping at Pier One and you approach a nice-looking lady.
"Say she plants her feet, stays in one spot, and seems genuinely riveted (not scared-riveted) by your commentary about how you simply don’t “get” throw pillows."
"Sure, keep the conversation going, but if she keeps on walking, do not follow."
Never follow a woman!
"If you’ve left a woman without an easy escape from interacting with you, you’re doing it wrong."
"This is also why you should never, ever, ever hit on a woman while she’s at work."
She’s not interested in you—she’s doing her job.
She’s being paid to be nice to you.
"At one time or another, we’ve all felt a connection with the Trader Joe’s cashier who compliments us on our choice of turkey corn dogs, but they don’t really care."
Your hairdresser is also not hitting on you; she’s trying to make sure her Yelp reviews don’t dip.
"I’m sure that hitting on someone in any of these scenarios probably seems “harmless,” a word men throw around with abandon. But it’s not."
It can actually be really scary for women.
"And putting aside the Bundy extreme, it’s really annoying to have to pause your day so that a man you’ve never met can tell you that based on literally nothing but your appearance, he wants to “get to know you”."
"If it would be annoying for a man to stop and talk to you, a man, during an activity, then don’t do that to someone else."
"To some extent, bars, concerts, sporting events, festivals, parties, weddings, and the like are places where being hit on—while still not always welcome—is expected."
Women often use our friends as safety buddies when we go out.
"I can almost guarantee that at one point or another, you’ve seen women go to the bathroom as a group in order to save one of their friends from a guy who won’t leave her alone."
"Not only are men less likely to do creepy shit in front of other people, but just having friends nearby in a bar gives women a slew of escape plans."
"If a woman ever tells you that she has to go “find her friend,” let her go."
"Again, do not follow her; do not offer to help her find her friend."
"She’s not being ""forced"" to go back to her friends."
"We have plenty of signals to let our lady friends know when we’re having fun with a guy, or if we need help Irish-goodbyeing his ass."
"If you’re dancing with a girl and her friend keeps stepping in or grabbing her hand to pull her away, her friend is not “cock-blocking” you: Your dance partner has probably been trying to get away for a while."
"And even without friend-assists, there are a lot of signs you can watch out for."
"If a woman says she’s going to the bathroom and she doesn’t come back, don’t circle the bar seeking her out."
"And if you offer to buy a woman a drink at a bar and she says she isn’t finished with her last one, that means ""no""."
"Do not buy her a drink then, and certainly don’t offer to buy the next one."
"Lastly, if a woman says that she’s tired, or that she thinks she’s just going to head home, that is not an opportunity for you to invite yourself, or to beg her to stay out."
"Women do give you clues, and often they’re pretty clear."
"While many men have good intentions when hitting on women, they often seem to misunderstand just how terrifying it can be to be approached by a stranger."
A lot of men also underestimate just how many bad experiences most women have had turning men down.
"It’s not that we don’t wish we could tell you all, straight-up, “leave me alone” or “fuck off, Beyoncé is playing right now and no man should be speaking until she’s done”."
"We just know that if we’re boring enough and keep giving one-word answers, you might think it was your idea to leave us alone, which is less likely to make you angry, aggressive, or even violent."
"I promise you that if you misread the signs and leave a conversation too early, a woman who is sincerely interested in you will just come find you across the bar."
"The beloved brand launched their own beauty collection exclusively at ASOS.com called Crayola Beauty, bringing crayons conveniently back into our everyday lives it's safe to say we are fangirling big-time."
"Of course, we will find ourselves needing all 95 colors, just like we did in elementary school."
"The 58-piece collection features whimsical, one-of-a-kind products that are sure to ignite a childish wonder and excitement you can choose from color-changing lipsticks, eye palettes, bright highlighters, bold mascaras, and an artist-like brush kit, just to name a few."
Also note the vanity-worthy packaging.
"Available in a plethora of eye-popping, mesmerizing colors (to say the least) this dreamy product is perfect for eyes, lips, and cheeks alike but not exclusively."
"We can't applaud Crayola enough for staying true to their humble, affordable ways."
Not only does the collection range in price from $15-$40 (amazing) but it is gender-fluid and promotes “self-expression and personal creativity.
"Courtesy of Crayola and ASOS Getting ready in the morning has never felt more like playtime hopefully, this line brings some lightheartedness to your AM adulting routine."
"Golfer Billy Horschel knows how to make a fashion statement, perhaps better than anyone else on the PGA Tour."
"At the 2013 U.S. Open, Horschel got everyone's attention with the octopus-printed pants he wore during the final round, and since then, he's continued to be one of the most fashion-forward golfers hitting the greens."
So it's no surprise that Horschel has become the first-ever athlete to collaborate with Ralph Lauren on a clothing line.
"The 2014 FedExCup winner is collaborating with the 50-year-old American brand on a capsule collection for men and women, the RLX x Billy Horschel Collection, which includes summer and fall lines of pants, knitwear, layering pieces, outerwear, polos, and shorts the latter inspired by Horschel's attention-grabbing octopus pants."
"It's pretty humbling to be the first, especially when you look at the actors, celebrities, athletes, and other people who have worn Ralph Lauren over the years."
"Men's Journal caught up with Horschel to speak about being the first-ever athlete collaborator with Ralph Lauren, how he trains, his favorite pieces from his new line, and why he picked Jay Z as his tee shot walk-up music."
What does it mean to you to be the first-ever athlete to collaborate with Ralph Lauren?
"I've been part of the process a little bit, mostly with working with them on how the clothes fit, and with certain style and design ideas."
"It was so exciting for me, being with it from beginning to end, helping select the colors to use, and style of pants that we wanted, the stripe patterns, and working on how the little details to certain shirts helped make them stand out a little more."
"Obviously, everyone knows me for wearing some crazy pants, but I'm a really big proponent of the little things and how they can make things stand out a bit more."
"When I first wore the octopus pants at the 2013 U.S. Open, that kind of put me on the map with fashion, so we pay homage to that with the shorts."
"I'm going to wear that version on Wednesday, since we're allowed to wear shorts for the PGA Championship practice round."
"We also have a rain jacket, and you don't see this a lot in golf these days, we have a similar type of jacket, but short sleeved."
It's a waterproof-type design and it's great to wear when it gets a bit nasty out there.
Courtesy of Ralph Lauren The PGA Tour gave players the chance to use walk-up music at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans which Horschel won along with partner Scott Piercy.
"I picked Jay Z because my partner at the tournament, Scott Piercy, we're both Jay-Z fans, and that song Forever Young we both like the beat and the rhythm."
"It's calming and pumps me up at the same time, and it was great to use when we were going to tee off."
"I was going to suggest using Warren G, Regulate on Sunday, but we were playing so well all weekend I didn't want to change it up [laughs]."
"It's cool to see that the tour is having some fun, and kind of show that you can have fun out here and still be respectful to the game at the same time."
"The majority of guys listen to music before a round of golf or when they're at home playing golf, so to have that on the first tee is fun and the fans enjoyed it."
How Golfer Justin Thomas Overhauled His Training and Fueled a Breakout PGA Tour Season How important is stretching and flexibility to your game?
How often do you use the Massage Envy Player Performance Center?
"I have my own trainer and a physiotherapist, and we've worked on getting my body more flexible; I've leaned out a lot."
"I do use the guys on the trailer once in a while, I'll sometimes get massages and get stretched out after rounds."
"If there's a day I wake up and something feels off in my body, I'll go see the guys if my physio isn't on the road with me."
It's vital now for guys.
"I hired a physio a few years ago, and I've seen the added benefit, and you see a lot of guys doing that and getting worked on."
"There's like 10 physios that travel now on tour, and of those guys, it's like 60 players out there that they treat."
You're seeing a lot of guys hiring their own physios.
"So people are embracing doing stuff in the gym correctly, but also embracing that recovery part as well."
What do you love most about playing at the PLAYERS Championship?
"Over my first two days at the PLAYERS Championship, I played really well for how bad I hit it [laughs]."
"Living here and playing this course a lot, I know where I can miss and still get up and down the hole, so that was helpful."
"The Ponte Vedra fans and Jacksonville fans are amazing and always come out here, and me living here for about nine years, they've been great to me."
"I love this event, it's the Tour, it's our tournament, I do think it's the fifth major when you think of how guys prepare for it, they really do take it seriously."
"Guys here are hitting more chips and more putts on every hole, they're being more diligent about their practice."
"As a golfer, what areas of focus are most important to you when you're training?"
Legs are vital for golfers.
"When I work, I'm doing a little bit of strength, a little bit of flexibility, and also mobility."
"My lats, hips, and shoulders can get really tight, so I try and maintain that flexibility."
"When I get tight, I can't move as well, so I really have to keep those flexible if I want to hit well."
"After winning the FedExCup, I wanted to put on a little bit of muscle, and it was great, but it hindered me a little bit since I didn't take care of my flexibility, so now I've been doing a lot of mobility, and keeping my core strong."
"If I can have that strong core and be really mobile, it helps me create a lot of speed in my swing."
"If I want to work on leg strength or core stability, I like to do a lot of lunges."
"Split stance lunges with a row, or a split stance with a chest press at the end."
"When I first discovered my love of martial arts, I was a shy 18-year-old girl."
"I didn't wear much make-up and rather than flick through magazines and read about beauty like other girls my age, I would devour anything I could find about Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee."
I went to a Muay Thai class (a form of kickboxing that's generally regarded as the world's toughest martial art) and found something I'd never experienced before.
"I'd always been naturally good at sport at school, but this gave me a challenge and an escape from my own head when I was doing it, I felt completely focused."
"Unsure of how my parents would react to me doing what is often considered to be such a masculine sport, I kept it secret from them and got a part-time job in a chemist to be able to pay for classes."
"Every Sunday, I'd get up really early, do all my chores around the house and ask politely if I could go to the gym my mum had no idea that I was going to a martial arts gym that was 90% full of tough, macho guys."
"When I'm training and competing, I don't care about the way I look."
I'll wear a really hydrating moisturiser so that my skin feels good but that's all.
"Away from the ring, it's a different story."
She loves fashion and makeup.
"Thanks to my career I became the British and world champion for Muay Thai boxing for my weight category in 2016; I go to a lot of awards ceremonies, and for those, I like to wear heels and a beautiful dress."
"I'll go with foundation, concealer, lipstick, blusher and maybe a highlighter if I'm in the mood."
I have an extensive makeup collection I like to look elegant and pretty when I'm away from the gym but I still want to look like me.
"As a society, we're keen to put people into boxes either you're sporty or glamorous, you can't be both but that's not true."
I can be taken seriously as an athlete and look glamorous when I'm outside the ring.
"I firmly believe that when it comes to how you look and who you are, you should never try to please other people if you're pleased with yourself, then it will radiate through."
"Later on, I realised that I had become a role model and I didn't know how to embrace that."
"But eventually, I said to myself, you've got an amazing platform to really inspire the next generation: to inspire girls, Muslim women, people with ME and chronic fatigue (I've suffered for years), people from ethnic minorities, people from low-income backgrounds these are all obstacles I've faced in my own journey."
"But I've succeeded and because of that I feel confident and, yes, beautiful too."
"Being beautiful is simply about being bold and embracing who you are that, combined with learning your craft and working hard, is what makes people respect you."
"At the moment, so many girls are reluctant to pursue sport and I think that's often because they see it as somehow unfeminine."
That's something I'm determined to change.
"I train girls and some of them comment on my Instagram feed, and say it's amazing that I don't use filters to make myself look better in photos."
"I try to explain that I don't need to do that because I'm confident in how I look whether that's sweating and makeup-free in the ring, or all dressed up, in mascara and lipstick."
"Either way, I'm comfortable as I am and that's what I want them to feel, too."
I want them to discover what their bodies are capable of everyone has strengths and it's about discovering yours and pursuing that.
"While I've got the strength and the fighter's mentality from kickboxing, the timing, the balance, the guard and the footwork are all different."
A fighter's mentality is about having resilience.
I've got to rely on myself and know how to be my own best friend.
"Many female authors rose to prominence in the mid-nineteenth century, a period the literary scholar Elaine Showalter calls The Age of the Female Novelist."
But this age also witnessed the development of narrow ideas about women writers and how and what topics they should write about.
"In 1904, G.H. Lewes identified sentiment as a consistent feminine literary trait; George Eliot, herself a woman, believed that maternal affections distinguished books written by women."
"Despite a century's worth of women's rights movements since then, male (and sometimes female) writers still talk about female authors through the lens of The Lady Writer."
"In 1965, Bernard Bergonzi explained that women novelists like to keep their focus narrow on domestic topics, while more recently, V.S. Naipaul declared no living or dead female author could be his equal because they are bogged down by their limited, sentimental sense of the world."
Gay Talese claims that not a single female writer has influenced his work.
This has been the unyielding consensus since the 1880s: Women writers are excessively emotional and can only write about things like family or feelings.
"Since the early 2000s, gender inequality in the culture industry literature, music, and film has become the site of increasing protest."
Calls for more and better roles for women in mainstream movies have become commonplace in the last five years.
"In the world of writing, gender bias has come to be seen as particularly entrenched, and in 2009, VIDA a group of volunteers interested in drawing attention to gender inequality in the field of book reviewing began what they called the count."
Men appeared 66 percent more often in The New York Times Book Review.
"These numbers are valuable because they can track how often publications deign to review books by women, but what they can't track is how reviewers then treat women's work: how they write about women and the stereotypes they invoke."
We decided to analyze the contents of recent book reviews to see if men and women were written about differently when their books were under review.
"Second, The New York Times has been directly responsive to the VIDA study in acknowledging gender imbalance in its pages and seeking to address this problem."
The improving numbers at The New York Times are often pointed to as evidence that things are getting better.

Men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
We've grown up being taught that both the genders are meant to be as different as chalk and cheese.
"They experience, express and perceive things physically and emotionally on different levels altogether."
"For instance, research shows that an average male uses more than 7,000 words per day while women can go up to 20,000."
"Most of the words spoken by men focus on facts whereas, for women, it includes a lot more like narrating their experiences to other people, re-telling stories to children or recapping television episodes etc."
Men listen more and use the information for problem-solving.
"Women, on the other hand, like to use it as a bonding exercise and hence, they tend to get miffed when men seem to zone out during conversations."
"This is one simple element that also tells us why a man's brain operates in a different way when it comes to maintaining intimacy, where men tend to use more actions instead of words!"
"Women, on the other hand, can easily express their feelings and intimacy by establishing a deep emotional connection."
"Coming back to the topic, intimacy goes beyond just sexual intercourse because in that case, it becomes a case of physical intimacy."
"Let's find out what it means for men with the following pointers:It is All Hormonal Men are blamed for focusing solely on physical intimacy, which makes emotional intimacy take a backseat."
"But the truth is that men do participate in and enjoy multiple forms of intimacy, which includes intellectual intimacy, experiential intimacy, emotional intimacy and physical intimacy."
"However, it is assumed that they tilt to only one particular type of intimacy and that is, physical intimacy."
"This is exactly what one of the greatest shows of all-time, Netflix's Mad Men too depicts."
"Don Draper for instance, experiences a wide range of intimacy with the different women in his life."
"While he is emotionally intimate with Anna Draper and has physical intimacy with a number of women throughout the series, he is intellectually intimate with Peggy Olson."
"Another reason why women experience intimacy differently is that they have higher oxytocin levels, which is a type of bonding hormone."
Men tend to release a high level of this hormone around their orgasms.
"Therefore, it is usually after a close physical experience they feel more emotionally closer to their partners."
"Among men, sex sometimes results in intimacy; among women, intimacy sometimes results in sex."
It can be said that they communicate better by using sex as a medium.
"Moreover, they experience emotions less intensely than womenfolk do and even if they do experience it, they may express it in a way different manner."
"Today, men tend to convert one feeling into another."
"In particular, they convert what is stereotypically feminine feeling like sadness and vulnerability into anger or pride."
These emotions have been associated with them from time immemorial and are more accepted by us as a society.
That does some explaining!
"They will never admit it, but men hesitate from discussing their needs when it comes to intimate relationships."
"While this stems from how they are conditioned from childhood, they do have need for emotional intimacy, especially in the form of appreciation by their partners."
"Let's not forget the fact that men have frail egos and appreciation them on and off keeps it afloat, whether they are praised at work or thanked profusely by their friend and family."
They would like to know what do their partner find more attractive about them and how they are doing great.
It makes them feel more connected.
"At the same time, when you respect a man and approve of the things he does, big or small, it will mean a lot."
"They will feel respected and therefore, find it easier to trust and love you."
"We've talked about how the society views men and their actions, some of which are labeled as weak."
"Nevertheless, there are chinks in the armor and men to open up emotionally but to the right person and the right time."
"Speaking of which, men may take a lot of time to open up on an emotional level."
"Because guys brains are hard-wired to handle fewer emotions than women, they cannot cope when there's a head rush of emotions such as immediately after having sex."
This is why they will need to take a breather and want space to sort out the flow of emotions.
That answers why do men need space after sex or after they go through any other emotional upheaval.
The WrapMen are complex creatures and every man is different.
This means you can never judge the man or men in your life based on only a handful of facts.
The key lies in understanding the subtle and not-so-subtle differences.
What's your take on men and intimacy?
Most of us have gone through at least one breakup and the difficulty of navigating the post-break up period.
How about staying in touch with your ex after a breakup?
"Here are five ways to help you deal with your ex: Create New Boundaries Immediately after a breakup, you'll want to create new boundaries between you two."
"That means no contact for at least three months: no emails, no phone calls, no texting and no face-to-face meetings unless it's unavoidable."
"Maybe you have kids, are attending the same college or running the same business."
You just have to find a way around it without prying into each other's post-breakup recovery.
An online dating guide offers some pretty simple and effective tips on how to get your ex girlfriend back.
"You loved, you made a mistake, and now you're dealing with the heartache of trying to move on."
"It's important to avoid being each other's comfort, especially during the post-breakup mourning period."
"Instead of finding comfort in your ex, build a support system from your inner circle of friends, preferably your closest friends."
"If your ex calls, texts, emails or stops by your house or place of work to seek some comfort, don't be too quick to open up your arms unless you're both considering getting back together."
"It may seem hard to avoid offering some form of support, but trying to avoid each other after an initial breakup is crucial to the healing process."
"After a break up, it's natural to feel some form of resentment, anger and even bitterness."
"And in this era of social media, most of us end up going online and spewing our relationship issues in front of followers, readers and viewers."
"According to an Independent article on what to avoid doing on social media after a breakup, it's important to be cautious with whatever you update on social media."
"You'll want to avoid any form of cyberstalking your ex, as it only makes the situation worse."
"If you had updated your relationship status, you might have to consider changing it after a breakup, but how and when you do it is up to you."
"While it's hard to move on during the initial stages of the post-breakup period, this is perhaps the best time to reassert your life and find something you can do."
"You could go on vacation, train for an upcoming marathon or engage in a something you've always wanted to do."
Just don't be too dramatic in what you do to increase your chances of moving on or even getting her back.
"The better you're able to deal with your ex, the better your chances of learning how to maintain your next relationship or even trying to get her back."
"Everyone who tells you that you just need a girlfriend and your life will instantly transform into a festival with rainbows, unicorn, and an unlimited amount of candy (no pun intended) has never been in a relationship."
"In a time where people are obsessed with instant gratification, it seems like a terrible trade."
"Your mom, your grandma, and your creepy uncle Charlie have told you that being in a relationship is worth it."
"Heck, your mom even told you that you should get married before 30."
"For now, we're talking about being in a committed relationship with a woman who loves you."
At least I hope she loves you.
And I hope you love her too.
"Yes, as cheesy as it sounds, love is the most important foundation for a relationship."
But I have to be honest about something most guys who are in a relationship will only tell their therapist.
Being monogamous is boring for guys
"If sex is your motivation, you can have as many steamy nights with her as you want, but do not make her your girlfriend."
There are so many guys who start relationships with girls because they are sexually attracted to them and not because they are emotionally compatible.
"But unless you have a strong emotional connection with a woman, your relationship will fail."
"That's a fact and no matter how many times your friend Jerry tells you that he wants to have sex with his girlfriend every day, it doesn't change anything."
He's lying because he's together with his girlfriend for more than six years and because he's too proud to admit the truth.
That's how we human beings are designed and no amount of fresh lingerie or perfume can change that.
"In fact, you will be even more motivated to improve your relationship, now that you accept the universal truth about female sexuality."
Stop bullshitting yourself and transform your relationship into an amazing adventure.
Having an Affair with Your Girlfriend Can HelpDo you want to know how to stay motivated in a long-term relationship?
It's a simple psychological tip and I swear to God it works better than buying new lingerie for your girlfriend.
Remember how you treated your girlfriend on your first date.
You were excited to see her.
You hugged her and kissed her whenever you had the chance.
You explored her body whenever you were alone.
You whispered sweet words in her ear.
Treat her exactly as you treated her at the beginning of your relationship.
Come home from work and think about what you would do if a new girl was lying in your bed.
"Imagine that she's your lover, your affair."
"If you program it the right way, you can turn your relationship into a long-lasting affair that's more exciting than other people's real affairs."
"Having someone who shares your visions means a lot, of course, being in a relationship is not all about sex."
"You have to eat, you have to work, and you have to talk to each other."
"If you are in a relationship that is based on open and honest communication, it's easy to stay motivated."
Your relationship is your motivation because you have someone who you can share your vision with.
Saying behind every great man is a great woman is not completely redundant.
"We men hate to admit it, but we are no emotional robots."
"When life kicks you in the nuts, you need someone who is there for you."
"I admit that having parents and friends can also support you in this situation, but having a girlfriend is different."
Having a girlfriend who is there for you in good times and in bed times is extremely valuable and should be motivation enough to make your relationship work.
The Grass is Always Greener on the Other Side Should you learn how to get a girlfriend or should you stay single?
Should you stay in your relationship or should you leave?
It's your choice and just because I or anyone else chooses a certain path doesn't mean that it's right for you.
Years into the 21st century where the feminism revolution and the MeToo movement is headline news you wouldn't think that rich and powerful middle-aged men spoiling young and beautiful women would be very popular let alone socially acceptable.
"Well, think again because in the same world there's also a movement of women reemerging who want to be taken care of and love having a strong, confident, and old school man at their side and quite frankly, are OK with the relationship not ending in marriage."
Welcome To The World Of Sugar Dating
Coming to the realization that my grey hair and less than perfect body I've earned from years sitting at a desk wasn't going to earn me my ideal woman.
"I decided I couldn't just remain holed up forever hoping to run into Mrs.Right while running around the corner for a bite to eat, and at this point in my life marriage wasn't really on my mind, but having someone special around when I wanted the company was necessary to keep my spirits up and my mojo flowing."
"I needed to get myself out there, so I tried going out to a couple of bars only to find myself feeling completely out of place among the millennial crowd."
"I retreated back to my cold and lonely apartment and called up my investor buddy, Matt, to see if he wanted to get a drink."
That's when he told me all about his escapades as a sugar daddy.
"At first, I scoffed at him and his almost whimsical stories of dating drop-dead gorgeous college girls that reportedly swooned over him."
"Yeah right dude, you know they're just gold diggers after your money, I jadedly responded."
"Gary, he tells me, I'm not marrying any of these women, and they know it, they simply want a mature guy like me to make them feel good and flip the bill."
"Look, you're an older guy who likes younger girls."
Who can blame you for preferring the youthful beauty and optimistic approach to life they possess?
These days you've got better things to do than going out till the wee hours of the morning at a venue where the music's so loud you can't hear yourself think.
"Plus with your responsibilities at work, not being switched on the following day could cost you."
"Plus let's face it, even if you did go out to the bars and clubs where younger girls spend their nights, are you really going to succeed?"
"Competing with guys their age in that setting is not playing to your strengths, and alcohol never leads to good decision making, yet you could be her best choice even if she doesn't know it yet."
"It's the only setting where older guys are the MOST desirable, regardless of the girl's age."
"These girls appreciate your life experience and the fact you're working a proper job with some cash at your disposal, unlike most of the guys their age."
You can meet younger girls in a non-awkward way.
The best part is all the girls on there want an arrangement so you can both be upfront about your needs and figure out a mutually beneficial relationship.
That's how my new embarkment into the sugar dating world started.
"Before getting on the site, Secret Benefits, I decided it would be best I look into sugar dating further before I get into something I've never done before."
"The amount of articles out there on the subject took a lot of sorting through, but in a nutshell there are the people who don't see it as a moral issue and there are those that do."
"There are always going to be opposing ends to all subjects with a little controversy, so I decided that there is no better way to find out how I feel about it than jumping right in, or dipping my toe into the sugar bowl asÂ Secret BenefitsÂ puts it."
After a painless and quick signup on secretbenefits.com I went to their blog to see what both sides are all about.
This is what I took away from the sugar daddy perspective:ProsYou don't have to be rich to be a sugar daddy as it's more about her financial situation and what you both want and need out of the relationship.
"You don't have to be good looking to be intimate and share companionship with young, hot girls."
"Women come to you, you screen and vet them, older guys are the most successful, and your looks are not as relevant."
Dating a sugar baby is much more transparent than traditional dating.
You set the rules and spell out exactly what you are looking for in a woman and in a relationship.
You are not going to waste your time or money on someone that is looking for something you're not.
"Let's face it, we all have picked up the tab at dinners and drinks to only find out you are both not on the same page."
With sugar dating the guesswork is taken out before you ever meet.
ConsYour sugar baby may be rough on the pocketbook.
"Some may not ask for much, but many expect to be wined and dined and even pay for schooling, and no, it's not tax deductible."
You may find yourself falling in love.
"Yes, she may be the girl of your dreams, but she's most likely got big dreams and they don't necessarily include you."
Some sugar daddies have made the mistake of sending gifts off to sugar babies they never met.
If you're planning to run for office or have a high profile status having a current or past sugar baby may not look so good on the resume.
As far as the sugar baby perspective goes this is what I was able to gather: ProsYou get to set your boundaries.
Your profile spells out exactly what you are and are not willing to do.
This is normally understood and respected before you ever meet in person.
Your self-confidence explodes knowing you are dating a man that adores you and wants to spoil you.
Worrying about finances or paying for school can be a thing of the past.
You could get to travel the world and get a taste of the glamorous life.
There are many reasons why so many women love silver foxes.
He may have a wandering eye.
If you're the jealous type this may not be the dating scene for you.
The chances are he's not looking for marriage or a live in girlfriend.
Showing off your sugar daddy to your friends and family will most likely not be a good idea.
No one wants to be judged and you don't want to explain your relationship to the folks.
"Most sugar daddies are used to calling the shots in their lives, so they most often are not going to be negotiating with you."
Surprisingly the more I looked into sugar dating and experienced it for myself I found it has little to do with sex and money.
I went out a few times with a really beautiful and intelligent young lady named Sara that's been going to NYU and has dated a few sugar daddies over the years.
"I asked about her experience, and she basically went on to explain that it began as a means to an end to pay for her schooling."
Being a sugar baby was never something I considered until I started looking at going to school here in the city.
"It just wasn't going to happen unless I was up to my ears in debt that I most likely would struggle to pay off for the rest of my life, so I knew about the concept of sugar dating and gave it a try."
"I've dated all kinds, from Wall Street guys to doctors and lawyers, and even an ex-pro athlete, but it was never about one-night stands."
"If the subject ever came up, I just said thanks but no thanks."
I almost felt like she was warning me even though we were just going out for a dinner date and drinks.
Like you must have seen on my profile I'm trying to pay for my schooling and I'm not interested in any kind of sexual relationship.
"Of course, guys try sometimes, my profile is not going to deter them all from asking, but that's why most everyone asks what the other is looking for before we ever meet."
"Since I started dating sugar daddies I've been able to cover nearly 60 grand in school expenses, and I've been able to go to a few really cool places too, but my schooling always comes first, so I can't always just jet set which has ended a few of my sugar daddies contacting me again, but hey, I can't sacrifice immediate gratification for my future."
"I was really taken aback by Sara, and although we only went out a few times she really left an impression on me."
For the past 6 months or so I've been seeing a really sweet and attractive artist named Jocelyn.
What a bombshell she is.
We have a great time together whenever we go out and I love having her stay over with me.
"Yes, I have agreed to pay for her studio and help support her art classes and supplies, but it's nothing in exchange for her uplifting and quirky energy that brings so much joy to my life."
"Society may not entirely agree that sugar daddies and sugar babies are socially normal or acceptable for that matter, but the truth is mutually beneficial relationships have existed since the beginning of time."
Would it be great that all women could comfortably support themselves and their dreams and not need a man to help out?
"Yes, of course, it would, yet this is not a reality for all women, and when they are put up against the odds of poverty and higher education, a life of scraping by and a lifestyle that gives them confidence and self-worth, who are we to judge?"
"It's no wonder after all that there are both young men and women in need of support and companionship in a world where just getting by is a harsh reality for the greater majority of the population, and if there is a way to bring these people together in a mutually beneficial relationship then why not?"
"Women are running for Governor, men and money stand in their way."
She is one of several female Democrats facing well-financed male opponents with deeper establishment support.
"When Chris Giunchigliani told former Senator Harry Reid about her plans to run for governor of Nevada in 2018, he candidly told her that he thought her opponent, Steve Sisolak, would make a stronger candidate, Ms. Giunchigliani recently recalled."
"Mr. Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, was even blunter when he warned the president of Emily's List, Stephanie Schriock, that the Democratic women's group would be inviting disaster if they spent heavily for Ms. Giunchigliani, according to two Democrats who described the private conversation on condition of anonymity."
"Were Ms. Giunchigliani, a veteran officeholder and outspoken progressive, to be nominated, Mr. Reid said, the casino executives who dominate Nevada politics would not only throw their support to Adam Laxalt, the likely Republican candidate for governor — they would also work to wrest control of the state Legislature away from Democrats."
His plea fell on deaf ears.
"Ms. Giunchigliani now faces an uphill primary election here Tuesday against the better-funded Mr. Sisolak and while Mr. Reid was focused on ideology, she attributes some of the resistance to her campaign to her gender."
"It takes a lot of work to prove to people that you have that credential, Ms. Giunchigliani said, recounting her years in the Legislature, on the Clark County Commission and a stint as head of the Nevada Education Association."
"Riding in an aide's Ford Escape last week, between an hour of evening canvassing in searing heat and a reception with gay and lesbian supporters, Ms. Giunchigliani argued, Sometimes a man can just say, I'm a businessman whether they are or aren't."
"And no one questions that, whereas a woman has to still prove it."
"Even as women have emerged as the animating force behind the backlash to President Trump, with many storming to victory in congressional primaries, several are finding governor's races to be more challenging as they struggle to build as much political and financial support as their male rivals."
"In interviews, several said they are facing entrenched resistance to female power at the executive level, and male opponents with deeper campaign coffers and, in some cases, far less political experience."
"Far from the Nevada desert, Maine's attorney general, Janet Mills, delivered a more bluntly feminist message on Friday."
Ms. Mills began her campaign for governor as a front-runner but has faced difficult competition from both male and female opponents ahead of Maine's primary on Tuesday.
"Her strongest challenger appears to be Adam Cote, a military veteran and businessman running as an outsider."
"So, in the shadow of the state capitol in Augusta, Ms. Mills sought to rally women to her side."
"Describing her background as a district attorney and legislator, Ms. Mills cast gender as central to her campaign and portrayed her opponents' attacks as part of an all-too-familiar trap for women."
"Now, men say: Well, you have a great resume, but you're kind of an insider, as Ms. Mills said, to groans from a predominantly female crowd of about four dozen."
"For decades, men were telling women: Just a little more experience and you'll be qualified."
"She finished with gusto: Well, goddamn it, I am qualified!"
"A year and half after Hillary Clinton failed to win the highest executive office, there have been a few signal victories for Democratic women in governor's races: Stacey Abrams in Georgia became the first black woman ever nominated for governor there, defeating another woman in May."
"New Mexico Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham dispatched male opponents in a Democratic primary last week to become her party's first Latina nominee for governor, and women have been nominated in longer-shot races for governor in Texas and Idaho."
"But in several of the biggest states on the map, women have strained to break through or appear at risk of falling behind."
"Some may win despite being outspent by male opponents, but the financial disparity points to the lingering institutional barriers confronting female candidates who try to crack the glass ceiling of the statehouse dome."
"You can't wait to be asked because a lot of guys won't ask you, said Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor."
"You have to crash the party and, if there's an opening, go for it because a lot the party organizations are run by the old boys."
"Ms. Sebelius helped recruit a female, Laura Kelly, to run for governor in her home state."
But there are few former female governors to clear the path for other women.
State capitols remain dominated by self-perpetuating male political networks that determine who is groomed and promoted and the outsiders who do force their way into the nominating process are often rich men wielding fortunes.
"The summer primaries will test Democrats enthusiasm for electing female executives: In Colorado, Cary Kennedy, a former state treasurer who would be the state's first female governor, is battling Representative Jared Polis, a multimillionaire who has spent $10."
"In Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislative leader, is battling a businessman who is pouring millions into his own campaign, Shri Thanedar, with no political experience, and Abdul El-Sayed, a liberal insurgent."
And some officials openly questioned the wisdom of putting forward another woman for governor Jennifer Granholm ran the state until 2011 which infuriated female strategists.
"And in Florida, Gwen Graham, a former member of Congress whose father was a revered governor and senator, is currently trailing in the polls to Philip Levine, the wealthy mayor of Miami Beach who has personally financed an enormous advertising blitz."
"Faced with the onslaught, Ms. Graham has started more directly invoking her gender."
"Everything I do is through the prism of being a mom, she said in an ad she began airing last week."
"In an interview, Ms. Graham said women bring a different approach to politics and mused excitedly about the prospect of her and Ms. Abrams being neighboring governors together."
"At the moment, there are just two Democratic women governors: Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Kate Brown of Oregon."
"Ms. Raimondo faces a potentially bruising re-election fight, including a primary challenge from a liberal male opponent, Matt Brown."
"Four Republican women currently serve as governors, though two inherited the job after male governors resigned."
"Ms. Raimondo said she was hopeful that 2018 would see breakthroughs for women in governorships, but that the country's political culture had been slow to embrace female executives."
"Ms. Raimondo said she had counseled a number of women around the country on their decisions to run, and had raised the paucity of female Democratic governors with party donors, many of whom, she said, were unaware of that reality and have historically been more focused on Congress."
"We just haven't seen a lot of high-profile female executives, Ms. Raimondo said."
"Ms. Giunchigliani got a stark reminder of the challenges women can face when she was rebuffed by Mr. Reid, who in retirement remains the de facto leader of the Nevada Democratic Party."
"Mr. Reid has helped clear the way for women in other races, including Nevada's Senate races in 2016 and 2018."
But this episode of backstage politics on which he would not comment reflects a deeper challenge for women candidates for governor: they rarely are the anointed ones.
"It takes a lot of work to prove to people that you have that credential, she said."
"They almost always have primaries because they are almost always in situation where aspects of the establishment just can't get their head around what a governor should be, said Ms. Schriock of Emily's List."
"We get the old, Yeah, she doesn't feel quite right."
"In Maine, supporters of Ms. Mills fear what they view as a repeat of the 2016 election, when a thoroughly well-credentialed woman lost to an aggressive male amateur."
"Nancy Wanderer, a retired law professor who applauded Ms. Mills at her Friday rally, seethed at what she described as unfair nit-picking by fellow Democrats and the news media."
"She has presented herself as a tough-minded corrective to the unpopular outgoing governor, Paul R. LePage, a Republican aligned with President Trump."
"Ms. Mills has presented herself as a tough-minded corrective to the unpopular outgoing governor, Paul R. LePage, a Republican aligned with Mr. Trump."
"But she has faced criticism for being insufficiently liberal on issues like gun control, where Ms. Mills has stopped short of endorsing a ban on assault-style firearms."
"Ms. Mills said in an interview she is seeking common ground on gun issues, and in a debate last week described having been threatened in her youth by an abusive partner with a firearm."
"Ms. Giunchigliani, too, has invoked her own harrowing personal story in her bid to become Nevada's first female governor."
"Responding to an attack from Sisolak supporters that claimed she sought to exempt teachers from a legislative proposal to expand reporting requirements for sex offenders, she unveiled a commercial revealing she had been sexually abused when she was eight."
"Ms. Giunchigliani who has gone by Chris G since teaching middle school and spells out the pronunciation, June-kill-e-on-e on business cards has closed a spending gap in her bid to succeed the term-limited Gov."
"She still trails Mr. Sisolak, her fellow county commissioner, in private polling, but got a last boost over the weekend when Hillary Clinton endorsed her and taped an automated call on her behalf."
"This is Nevada, she said."
They'll cover their bets.
He Has Taken the First Steps.
Mr. Johnsey was performing as part of the female corps de ballet.
"The ladies of the court, wearing long dresses and hats with trailing veils, moved in a stately minuet across the stage of the Coliseum Theater in London on Wednesday night, in the English National Ballet's production of The Sleeping Beauty."
"They tapped their canes on the floor as the Prince looked on, circling elegantly with uniform poise and charm."
One of those court ladies was a man: Chase Johnsey.
"For the first time in modern ballet history, a male dancer is performing as part of the female ensemble at an international ballet company, signaling an important moment in an art form that often celebrates a particular ideal of femininity."
"Or, as the great choreographer George Balanchine said, ballet is woman."
"But in a world with a heightened awareness of gender fluidity, and with transgender people increasingly accepted in a variety of professions, including acting and modeling, ballet is taking its own brave leap."
"I want to be seen as a ballerina, said Mr. Johnsey, an American, who identifies as gender fluid but uses male pronouns."
"My hair is up, I wear makeup, female attire."
"I am able to do female roles and look the part, so that is artistically what I do."
"Tamara Rojo, the director of English National Ballet who offered Mr. Johnsey a short-term contract in March, said she was very sensitive about this being seen as a publicity stunt."
"It's not like the theater, which has embraced gender-switching with all-female accounts of Shakespeare, say, or Glenda Jackson playing King Lear."
"These may require some suspension of disbelief from the audience, but not a fundamental change in appearance or skill from the performer."
"Female ballet dancers must conform, certainly in major companies, to specific aesthetic norms, which include thinness and ideas about harmonious proportions."
"And for the grand 19th-century classical ballets like Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty, the backbone of the traditional repertory the dancers in the female ensemble, known as the corps de ballet, must not differ too much from one another physically, since they embody collective groups of swans, sylphs or wilis (the spirits of jilted girls)."
There are also important technical differences between men and women in ballet.
"Men have bigger, more athletic jumps and turns, and they lift and carry the women."
"The female dancers perform on point dancing on their toes in stiffened ballet shoes a skill they begin to learn as teenagers, and which requires a different strength and training than men's."
"Mr. Johnsey, who has had facial surgery to feminize his features, already had some of these skills before joining English National Ballet."
"In an interview a few days before the opening of Sleeping Beauty he said he began to dance on point, secretly, as a teenager, after beginning ballet at 14."
"Three years later he joined Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, an all-male comedic troupe in New York whose dancers play both male and female roles."
"The Trocks, as they are called, perform technically demanding female roles on point."
"The Trocks, as they are known, perform technically demanding ballerina roles on point, and Mr. Johnsey was acclaimed for his brilliance and delicacy in these roles."
Last year he won the best male dancer award at Britain's National Dance Awards mainly for his appearances with the Trocks.
"Mr. Johnsey left the Trocks at the start of the year, alleging that he and other dancers were mistreated and harassed for appearing too feminine in classes and rehearsals."
"The company appointed an independent investigator, who did not substantiate these claims."
"But when Mr. Johnsey joined English National Ballet, he discovered that performing in drag with comic intent is very different from performing as part of a seamless female ensemble."
"And despite his strong point-work technique, he said he had completely the wrong idea about what makes a ballerina beautiful and graceful."
"It is actually strength, hidden within softness and grace, and I have had to figure out in my genetically male composition, how to find that."
"Mr. Johnsey is not appearing on point in Sleeping Beauty but in what are known as character, or soft-shoe, dances, with costumes less revealing than those for point-work roles."
"I am a small, petite guy, but I am a man, Mr. Johnsey, who is 5 feet 5, said."
"My shoulders are wider, my calves are bigger, the textures of my muscles are different."
"He added, I had to cannibalize my body, make it run on energy from muscles and figure out how to lose muscle mass without losing strength."
"I have never felt like a freak here, he said of his time with English National Ballet."
The company dancers had been welcoming.
"Isabelle Brouwers, a corps de ballet dancer who performs with Mr. Johnsey in the Mazurka in Act 3, said there had been no prejudice or hostility when he joined the company."
"I think it's a great and positive step in bringing ballet into the 21st century, she said."
"But while Mr. Johnsey's appearance with a ballet company can be seen as a boost for gender equality, it could also be viewed as a man infiltrating an already competitive female domain."
"Wendy Whelan, the former New York City Ballet principal, said she had conflicting feelings."
"I don't care what the body parts are, as long as artistically the dancer makes the choreography shine, Ms. Whelan said."
"If he is the best girl for the job, then great."
"But, she added, this could be another hurdle for women in a field that is more difficult for them to succeed in than men."
Living the life of a woman in ballet means not having access to the privileges that come with the patriarchy she added.
"And Isabella Boylston, a principal with American Ballet Theater, said that she didn't see an issue if they are open to it going both ways and have women in male roles too."
"Jennifer Homans, who wrote Apollo's Angels, a widely praised history of ballet, pointed out that female roles were performed by men at the earliest moments of ballet's history at the court of Louis XIV."
"Although ballet is a very gender-specific and rigid art form in some ways, she said, in other ways that's not true."
It has long been a platform for men to feel and express femininity.
"What matters, she said, was not whether men dance as women and women as men, but whether the effect is artistically interesting."
Will Mr. Johnsey's small step an unobtrusive appearance with the female corps in one of the most conventional of all ballets and companies be a breakthrough for gender fluidity in ballet?
"In the last few years, there have been far more instances of choreographers creating same-sex duets, and being more unconventional in casting choices; recently the choreographer Justin Peck, at the New York City Ballet, put a woman in a role originally conceived for a man."
"I think ballet can be the perfect environment for gender fluidity, Ms. Rojo said."
We are in a position where we could open up roles for lots of people.
"Could Mr. Johnsey be a swan, a princess or a wili?"

"Multi-generational holidays are on the rise in 2018, with grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, cousins, siblings and grandchildren all taking time out of their schedules to go away together and enjoy a well-deserved break."
"With so many families deciding to holiday together a few necessary questions arise “ what are the advantages and disadvantages of multi-generational holidays, and what family holidays are on the market for 2018?"
"If your family tends to bicker and quarrel, a holiday without the pressures and stresses of day-to-day life is an ideal way to get the family unit back on track."
"It's estimated that parents and children spend less than an hour with each other every day, due to heavy workloads and the demand of modern life."
"Parents are working, children are at school and the evening and weekends are taken up with a host of clubs, sports and play dates with friends."
Once money issues are sorted and the destination is chosen the biggest obstacles are the challenges of who sleeps in which room and what hotel or villa will your family go for.
ABTA's latest Travel Trends Report for 2018 states that families are opting for more all-inclusive hotels and resorts thanks to their diversity and good value for money.
"Tips for keeping the peace on multi-generational holidays include choosing a destination that offers something for everyone, hiring two smaller cars instead of one large one, and letting family members decide their own excursions."
"Multi-generational holidays Multi-generational holidays come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, from all-inclusive hotels to crewed yacht charters and island hopping."
"Families tend to go for a holiday that encompasses a range of activities, with good beach access and high-quality-rated rooms."
"With such a high demand for multi-generational holidays, retailers have taken up the challenge by creating multi-functional living spaces to accommodate all ages."
"Multi-generational cruising is also on the rise, with cruise liners like Cruise & Maritime Voyages taking the lead and offering reduced pricing for family holidays."
"Cruise & Maritime Voyages specifically sell multi-generational 7 and 12 night cruises, with a low child fare of just £99 pounds."
And it's not just the cruise lines who are innovating in the multi-generational holiday space.
Many package holiday providers have focussed their efforts on bringing the family together and encouraging group holidays to strengthen bonds.
"Raising kids is a complicated endeavor, and there's no one recipe for doing it right."
"Here, top child and family therapists share their insights into the qualities that are essential in an excellent mom or dad."
The major part of our job as parents is to eventually become dispensable.
"So, above all, we need to encourage our children to do things for themselves."
"Sadly, though, in the interest of time and efficiency, parents tend to do things for their children that the kids could easily do for themselves."
"In an effort to prevent them from feeling pain and discomfort, we rush in and rescue our children, rather than allowing them to learn from their mistakes."
"Of course, he needs to be taught how to do so, and he needs clothing that is easy to slip on and off."
"Yet so many parents continue to dress kids even when they're preschoolers, robbing them of the opportunity to develop capability and relish their accomplishments."
"Similarly, it's far more important to encourage children to consider the consequences of their actions than to try to protect them from making mistakes."
Children are affected by their parents' relationship in several ways.
"First, research has shown that adults who are in loving marriages are more effective parents."
They're more patient and more attentive to their children's needs.
"Unhappy parents, by contrast, are more inept when it comes to dealing with their children."
"Overcome with their own problems, they are unable to adequately care for someone else."
"But beyond that, the kind of marriage that a couple has profoundly affects the quality of the relationships that children will develop as they grow up."
"When kids watch their parents interact with one another respectfully, they get their first lessons in how to get along with other people."
"When they observe how their parents work through problems, they learn to resolve conflict."
"When they see their parents kiss, they feel comfortable and secure."
"In short, the strongest lessons children learn are from what goes on in their home, and the lessons of a good marriage will stay with them for life""."
"That doesn't mean, of course, that moms and dads need to be nonstop entertainers or amuse their kids every minute of the day."
"What it means is embracing the joy of a child's world and sharing it by being part of their play""."
"As we race from one event to the next, we often underestimate the value of downtime."
Fantasy play helps children explore who they are and who they want to be.
"Tossing a ball back and forth teaches athletic ability, sportsmanship, and cooperation."
Play is also the way that children recover from life's upsets.
They reenact important emotions with their dolls or action figures.
"After getting a shot, they want to play doctor and pretend to give you a shot."
Overscheduled parents may think they don't have time for playing with dolls or building with blocks.
"When we engage playfully with our children, we find that we suddenly have more energy and feel better about ourselves and our kids."
"After all, play engages us in our child's world, and what better way is there to forge a deep and lasting connection""?"
"No television for a week,' a mom may tell her child in the afternoon, only to make an exception that very night."
"But the fact is, if we relinquish our parental authority, we are doing a disservice to our kids""."
"When children are young, they crave limits."
"But by the time they reach adolescence, kids who don't see their parents as authority figures begin to look elsewhere for a code of conduct."
"They often find it in what I call 'the second family,' the collective power of the peer group and pop culture."
They lie without guilt; they experiment with drugs and alcohol; they have sex at frighteningly early ages.
"They do these things because in the world of their second family, such behavior is acceptable""."
The best way to protect kids from these outside influences is for parents to assert their authority with consistency and conviction from the time their children are young.
"But teaching values isn't the same as teaching a child to swim, kick a soccer ball, or play the piano."
"Gushing over a baby, smothering a toddler with kisses, or offering a preteen a reassuring smile are silent ways to say 'I love you."
No skills in parenting substitute for a mother's and father's attentive and committed presence.

"If you ever feel scared, approach a police officer and he will help you."
"In general, a nanny is concerned about her reputation amongst parents."
"In almost every society, from Baltimore to Beijing, boys are told from a young age to go outside and have adventures, while young girls are encouraged to stay home and do chores"
"The study found that by age 10, kids have internalized myths about gender norms."
"Lessons about gender start early, and they have lifelong consequences."
"A new study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found many norms around gender, what's expected of boys and girls, become entrenched in adolescence and have negative impacts that carry into adulthood."
Existing research shows gender roles can harm both sexes.
"But the Global Early Adolescent Study which looked at girls and boys between 10-14 years old in 15 countries with varying income levels found many of these stereotypes are universal, and they become entrenched before 10 years old."
"""We were actually anticipating more differences than similarities, and one of the big findings is that there are still very consistent forms of patriarchy around the world,"" said Kristin Mmari, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the lead qualitative researcher on the study."
"The ideas girls and boys have about gender, the study found, form earlier in adolescence than had previously been measured, Mmari said."
"""There seems to be a shift as soon as girls and boys enter this stage, where their attitudes and beliefs about the opposite sex change dramatically,"" she said."
That they could have these friends opposite sex friends and they were given equal amounts of freedom.
"The biggest myth perpetuated about gender, researchers found, is that once girls hit puberty, they are vulnerable and in need of protection to preserve their sexual and reproductive health, while boys are seen as strong and independent."
"It's this myth, Mmari said, that changes how the world sees both sexes during adolescence, and how it continues to treat them throughout their lives."
"""How you perceive girls and boys is socially driven,"" Mmari said."
"""It's not biologically driven""."
Among consequences that the study noted when girls conform to gender stereotypes: Depression Child marriage Leaving school early Exposure to violence And consequences when boys conform to gender stereotypes: Engaging in physical violence to a much greater extent than girls Dying more frequently from unintentional injuries Being more prone to substance abuse and suicide Having a shorter life expectancy than women
"The next phase of the study, which Mmari said will take about four or five years, will measure how gender norms change over time, what factors influence those changes and how they relate to health-outcomes for boys and girls."
"""We need to view gender as more of a system,"" Mmari said."
"So we feel like if we just empower girls, make them feel good, then we'll change."
"Did you conscientiously buy dolls for your son and trucks for your daughter, or did you try to avoid the whole thing and give them both gender-neutral artisanal wooden objects, only to be shanghaied by the princess industry and superhero underpants?"
Looking at how children play with toys that fall into gender stereotypes gives us a window on children's developing sense of what goes along with being a boy or a girl.
A new study suggests the potential power of words and images to counter gender stereotypes and open up what children see as possible interests and activities for themselves.
And experts say that those choices are significant because they can influence the skills children learn and the possibilities they see for themselves.
"Lauren Spinner, a developmental psychologist at the University of Kent in England, was the first author on a study published in January in the journal Sex Roles, which looked at the effect of showing 4- to 7-year-olds images of children playing with either stereotypic or counter-stereotypic toys."
"In one experimental group, the children followed gender stereotype"
"My name is Sarah, and my favorite toy is My Little Pony!"
"My name is Thomas, and every day I like to play with my cars."
"For the other experimental group, Sarah had the car and Thomas had My Little Pony; the language was otherwise identical."
"After they had seen the pictures, the children in the study were shown a set of toys, chosen to be stereotypically masculine and feminine (baby doll, jet fighter, tool kit, tea set) and asked who should play with which toy, and the children who had seen the counter-stereotypic pictures were more flexible in their answers, more open to the idea that both girls and boys might like toys from both sides of the conventional aisle."
They were also less rigid when they were asked which children from the pictures they wanted to play with; exposure to Sarah-with-the-car and Thomas-with-the-pony meant that children were more open to playing with representatives of the other gender.
So the toys in the pictures affected who the children wanted as playmates.
"Dr. Spinner pointed out that seeing the photos did not open up the children's preferences for what toys they themselves wanted to play with; they were more likely to say that other boys and girls could play with a variety of toys, but the two experimental groups were equally unlikely to make those counter-stereotypic choices themselves."
"On the other hand, she said, it was only one exposure, and it's possible, if there were more of those counter-stereotypic images around, that children might become more open to enjoying the whole spectrum of toys."
"Laura Zimmermann, a developmental psychologist who is a professor of psychology at Shenandoah University in Virginia, was the first author on a study published last year in the Journal of Children and Media, which looked at preschool children's responses to toy commercials."
"Children are showing more flexibility than they used to, she said, in terms of who they thought the ads were meant for, responding that both boys and girls, for example, could like Batman, or like the female line of Lego building blocks."
"Their behavior got much more stereotypical when they were asked their own preferences, she said, and the boys especially were unwilling to say that they liked any of the ads aimed at girls."
"But the ads themselves, she said, continue to reflect the same old stereotypes."
"My concerns are that children's ads shape and reinforce stereotypes, Dr. Zimmermann said."
"They are obviously not working alone; we have wider societal influences at work, but ads are powerful."
"This is not about taking away the doll, or banishing the train."
"If they aren't interested in engaging in non-stereotypic gender play that is O.K. too, Dr. Zimmermann said in an email."
Children should be free to play with the toys they enjoy toys should not be assigned by gender.
"Traditionally masculine toys like blocks and puzzles, Dr. Spinner said, encourage visual and spatial skills, while traditionally feminine toys encourage communication and social skills."
"We know that these stereotypes that are being shaped and reinforced can be linked to a lot of different things from educational and occupational goals to academic ability to social development, Dr. Zimmermann said."
"As children grow up, Dr. Spinner said, they do tend to become more flexible about what boys and girls can do; 7-year-olds are less rigid than 4- or 5-year-olds."
"Mixed gender play is really important, getting boys and girls to play with one another and recognize behavioral similarities, Dr. Spinner said."
"Children can overcome their anxieties about playing with other-gender children if you can get them to understand there are a lot of similarities in what they like to play with, rather than focusing on the gender of the child”."
"Somewhere between the ages of 2 and 3, children figure out whether they are boys or girls, developmental psychologists say, often citing Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of gender identity development; they go on from there to identify the people around them as male or female, and to create rules and categories of what behaviors and interests and habits go with which identity."
"The images children see can reinforce stereotypes and limit their horizons, but they can also open up possibilities and lead kids to believe that they have more choices."
"Children are actively seeking clues about what their gender identities mean; toys and play should give them space, not narrow their choices."
"Many parents have stories of a girl who insisted on rocking a toy train to sleep, or a boy who pushed a doll along the floor, making train noises, foiling well-meaning parental attempts to foster non-stereotypic play."
"And parents don't have to eradicate all stereotypical play, Dr. Zimmermann said in an email message."
"After all, a princess can play with worms."
Girls subject choices in school are one clear symptom of their unequal experiences.
"One example is that four times as many boys as girls take physics, a subject seen as having value by universities and employers alike."
As a society we have become inured to such disparities in choices and also to the deeper malaise it reveals.
Gendered stereotypes are pervasive in our culture ingrained by long-standing biases (both conscious and unconscious).
"They affect all of our expectations and, at an early age, those of our youngsters."
Many of the stereotypes relate to different expectations of boys and girls.
"We need many more good engineers, scientists and programmers."
"Second, there is a personal cost for young women as we limit their expectations."
There is no evidence to suggest any inherent differences between genders in either aptitude or interest in the sciences.
The Institute of Physics has run a pilot in schools in which staff identified and addressed any bias or stereotyping.
"The pilot schools showed a threefold increase in girls choosing physics A-level, as well as broader positive change for all."
"We all have a role to play government, educators, industry, parents and citizens in tackling the barriers that girls face."
"On International Women's Day on 8 March, let's each consider what change we can make."
"It is astonishing that, in 2018, girls still grow up being treated very differently from boys through entrenched stereotyping and unconscious biases."
"A guide for teachers on how young people understand gender stereotypes, their impacts and ways to challenge and discuss these with 9-11 year olds."
Gender roles and impacts Gender stereotypes are culturally-ingrained ideas about appropriate behaviours for males and females.
Common narrow gender stereotypes can include: that it is not ok for men to cry; that men are naturally aggressive; that females should be submissive and pick up the pieces.
Young people are largely aware of gender stereotypes by this age and will have begun to accept some of these as universal truths.
Rigid gender stereotyping promotes inequity between the sexes and can set young people up to expect and accept power imbalances within relationships later in life.
"This is an opportune time, before adolescence, to talk about the impact of gendered expectations on choices, existing friendships and future relationships."
Accepting gender stereotypes and roles can have longer-term negative influences on children's beliefs attitudes and future behaviours.
"One in four don't think that it is serious, if a man who is normally gentle with his partner, slapped her when drunk."
One in four think that street harassment is not serious.
One in six think that women should know their place.
One in six think that it is ok for a guy to pressure a girl into sex if they are both drunk.
"The benefits of tackling gender stereotypes with this age group include supporting young people to: Become aware of the messages that promote gender double standards and inequality in the media, online and within the broader community."
Know fact from fiction about sexuality.
"Understand the effect gender stereotypes can have on their options and roles in sport, at school and within their families."
Develop realistic expectations about future relationships based on mutual respect and equity.
Where do young people learn about gender?
"Young people may learn about acceptable gender roles and stereotypes from television, the internet or other media."
"Young people also learn about gender roles from the adults they respect, including their teachers."
Students can learn about gender stereotypes at school by: How teachers treat each other on a day-to-day basis.
"For example, boys receive prizes for being sporty and girls receive prizes for being good and quiet."
"Or the stickers they receive for a job well done, that is, girls receive pink stickers and boys receive more subdued stickers."
How teachers reward or discipline behaviour that adheres to accepted notions of gender.
"For example, using statements such as man up or excusing inappropriate behaviour through comments such as boys will be boys."
What do young people think about gender stereotypes and roles?
"Research conducted around Australia with young people aged between 9 and 11 years, indicates that they have an understanding of culturally accepted gender roles and the power dynamics associated with these."
"However, it is evident that young people also buy into these stereotypes and are often not aware of when and how stereotypes are impacting on their behaviours and choices."
"Therefore, conversations around identifying gender stereotypes can work best when supported by an adult such as a teacher who can assist young people to understand influences on identity, relationships and decision-making."
Some young people can see how early gender stereotyping begins: It's like when we go to buy something for a baby and everything for girls is pink and everything for boys is blue and there's no other colours (11 year old girl).
That stereotypes can change over time: Pink used to be a boy's colour but it's now a girl's colour” (11 year old girl).
This year my favourite colour is orange but last year it was blue (11 year old boy).
Young people are aware of power dynamics:Men are known to go out and get a job and get money while women have to stay at home and cook and clean (11 year old girl).
Men are paid more than women and more of them are CEOs and have the money (11 year old girl).
Schools making a difference Schools and teachers can support young people to challenge gender stereotypes and reach their full potential based on ability as opposed to gendered expectations.
"It isn't just about what is done in the classroom but throughout the whole school, including school leadership, administration, on the sporting field, and in the playground."
"For example, in the classroom, teachers can look at how they praise students: do male and female students receive equal praise for the same behaviour?"
"Are both males and females praised for being neat, speaking up in class, or being active in physical activities?"
Encouraging young people to be friends across genders can also be beneficial to their socialisation.
"Having policies that promote both gender equity and acceptance of diversity that apply across the whole school to students, teachers and parents, supports a safe and equitable environment where young people are exposed to positive messaging and role models."
"Many pre-teens are ready to actively engage in discussions about respectful relationships, gender roles and stereotypes."
"This is a key time prior to puberty, high school and before many young people start experiencing romantic relationships, as well as an age where gender stereotypes are becoming more cemented and begin to impact on future decisions such as subject and extra-curricular choices."
"On top of this, existing curriculum often re-enforces gendered stereotypes, for example through characters in books or examples used in maths and science texts."
Using class time to examine power dynamics and stereotyped representations within the curriculum can be beneficial to the development of young people's skills to critique negative messaging within learning materials and the media.
Age appropriate discussions about gendered expectations can include: Jobs and roles for women and men both inside and outside the home and how stereotypes can limit these options.
"Cultural expectations about feminine or masculine activities, fashion and behaviour"
who can have long hair?
Who can wear trousers?
Who has body hair?
Exploring young people's current judgements on gender and how this impacts on their expectations of themselves and treatment of others.
It can also be an ideal time to begin discussing power imbalances in relationships (friendships as well as romantic relationships).
"For example, the expectations that are often placed on young people in terms of how they interact with the opposite sex, such as asking girls to keep the peace and allowing boys to tease girls because they like them."
Tackling sexist language within the classroom and playground is also a way in which gender stereotypes can be called out.
"For example, challenging phrases such as you kick like a girl and questioning young people on what is really meant by this and how these statements could impact, hurt and limit potential."
"Bringing attention to female athletes, like the Australian soccer squad the Matildas, who have been more successful on the world stage than their male counterparts, could be a useful example to rethink how students view gender and the capabilities of their peers."
These minor changes can support an awareness of rigid gender stereotypes among young people and assist them to create respectful relationships and identities that challenge negative stereotyping.
Children discuss what it means to be a man in the media and what boys do that are contrary to what media and society tells them about being a man.
A humorous look at how limiting and tiring it would be for both women and men to live with childhood gender roles in adulthood.
The Sun revealed how PDC bosses have decided to scrap the fan favourites from the sport.
The models have accompanied players to the oche for more than two decades.
The girls claim bosses were caving in to pressure following the Dorchester hostess scandal in which an undercover reporter claimed she was groped at a men-only charity event in London.
"""It just brings a bit of glitz and glamour to an event that's predominantly male."
I can't think of a female job that's more safe.
"She said: ""What we are seeing is a broader social change that sees these roles as - if not demeaning to the individual, because this is an argument that it's a choice of some of these ladies - it's demeaning broadly to women."
I think the key here is that it's a sort of decorative role that's making money for men.
Every social change has people who suffer from it.
"Karen-Jean Cookson, 46, the first ever walk-on girl in 1994, said: ""It's political correctness gone mad""."
"Over 23,000 darts fans have how signed a petition to have walk-on girls return to darts."
"For the Ancient Greeks, Homer’s Iliad was the Bible on andreia — that is, manliness, particularly manly courage."
"For Alexander, Achilles was andreia incarnate, and so the young king patterned his life after him."
"For he embodies an ideal that they, deep in their gut, keenly desire: undaunted courage and physical prowess."
Achilles: Being Manliness Nothing could stop Achilles in battle.
"Achilles was fast, agile, and strong."
He made heroic feats look easy.
"His thumos, or spiritedness, burned white hot, so much so that it would often overtake him while he unleashed carnage on the battlefield."
Homer described him as “beautiful”.
"His uncontrollable rage, a hyper sense of honor, and a vulnerable heel all led to his early downfall."
But it was a price he had to pay to immortalize his perfect andreia and secure a legacy in which people still today talk about his excellence in courage and warfare.
"Yet, making Achilles one’s exemplar poses a significant difficulty for us mere mortal men…because Achilles wasn’t a mere mortal."
Achilles came out of the womb a man.
Andreia was just a part of his being.
"So while the andreia of Achilles can certainly serve as an ideal, his life isn’t a very useful pattern for most men to follow, unless of course, your mother happens to be an immortal Olympian goddess."
"There is, however, a character from the Iliad who does provide a helpful model for men on attaining andreia."
"Hector: Learning Manliness For nine long years, Hector led the defense of the city of Troy against the Greek onslaught."
"Unlike Achilles who was born with andreia, Hector had to learn it."
He even admitted so in perhaps one of the most touching scenes of Western literature.
"Hector, battle weary and covered with dust and gore after preventing a Greek route of his forces, comes back inside the protective walls of Troy for rest."
"There he meets his loving and loyal wife Andromache who begs him not to go back into battle, afraid the next time her husband returns, it’ll be on his shield, rather than with it."
"Hector, still in his armor, confesses to his wife that he shares the same fear."
"Achilles would have responded with a chortle, a boast, a patronizing retort to his wife not to worry her sweet little head about it."
But Hector is human and has some humility about his ability and his bravery.
"As he reflects to Andromache: “All this weighs on my mind too, dear woman."
"But I would die of shame to face the men of Troy and the Trojan women trailing their long robes if I would shrink from battle now, a coward."
"To stand up bravely, always to fight in the front ranks of Trojan soldiers, winning my father great glory, glory for myself”."
"He experiences courage not as a lack of fear, but the practiced ability to feel fear, and then decide to move forward anyway."
The Greek word for “learn” is didaskein and English professor David Mikics astutely notes that didaskein is never used anywhere else in the Iliad to describe learning about bravery or manliness.
"Homer is clearly setting up a contrast between Hector and his instinctively fierce rival, Achilles."
"While Achilles was born manly, Hector had to learn andreia."
"He had to learn how to be fierce and strong, which suggests it wasn’t in his nature to be so."
Instead Hector was probably by nature a nice guy.
"No, not the insufferable nice guy nice guy."
Hector was a good guy.
A caring husband and a loving father.
But he understood that goodness must be backed with strength.
"Hector recognized, like Theodore Roosevelt did millennia later, that “unless we keep the barbarian virtues, gaining the civilized ones will be of little avail”."
"And so he spent his life learning that which didn’t come naturally to him, but which he desired in order to live with andreia."
"He learned from observation and from practice how to be brave, daring, and strong."
Hector dedicated himself to an education in virile manhood.
Hector: A Fellow Traveler on the Path to Manhood I relate with Hector.
I think of myself as a “good guy”.
I’m naturally inclined to be kind and friendly towards others.
"And like Hector, I’m a family man."
"A courageous, fierce, thumos-driven, physically adept, and strong man?"
That’s something I’ve had to learn and am still learning.
I’ve come across some men who are more like Achilles.
"They were naturally courageous, physically adept, and comfortable with risk, even as boys."
"When I’ve met these sorts of men, I’ve found myself being awestruck."
"Like Achilles, they embody an ideal of virile manliness that I can’t help but respect, even if they’re a bit rough around the edges."
"But inspiring as these men can be, they don’t provide useful insights on how to develop that same sort of andreia."
It’d be like asking Usain Bolt how to become a faster sprinter.
"Instead, I prefer looking for the men who are by nature good guys like Hector, but who had to learn how to become fierce."
Those guys will have some pointers.
Most men I’ve encountered are fellow Hectors.
They’re good guys who have to work at being manly.
It can be easy to feel insecure about the fact that you have to constantly learn and re-learn how to be a man.
"Achilles-types sometimes scoff at the idea of actively trying to learn the art of manhood, and evince disbelief that other men haven’t known how to do certain skills since they were young boys, and don’t embody certain traits intuitively."
"Few men emerge from the womb with hair on their chest, or simply absorb the skills and traits of manhood from the ether."
"Lots of great men throughout history have had to intentionally set out to learn manliness, including Hector."
The Art of Manliness is where I’ve shared some of the ideas I’ve picked up along my journey towards that goal.
And it’s been great meeting other Hectors — good guys — along the way who’ve made the conscious decision to learn manliness too.
Men do not shrink from danger.
"He loves to experiment with his safety, his health, and his life."
"Tell him a thing is perilous, and he longs to do it."
"He loves the swimming-hole so deep he may drown, and the loaded gun, and the green apples that may give him the colic."
The gambler does not want money.
"Give him a million dollars, and he will put it all on the next turn of a card."
It is the excitement of that moment of peril he craves.
"The essence of interest in every Game is Danger, if not of life and limb, at least the presence of sufficient uncertainty to make it a “sporting proposition”."
"The English and the Americans are gluttons for danger, and hence they are confirmed sports."
"A lawsuit is not primarily to discover the facts and award justice, but one lawyer is pitted against another, and the public watches the contest with very much the same sensations it enjoys a prize-fight."
We cannot elect officials without making a game of it.
"From the gentle old lady who “loves her murders” in the morning newspaper, to the sophisticated theatregoer who is best pleased when the curtain falls on plenty of gore, we are all human."
"You have observed a curious thing: When this nation was about to enter the late war the country was consumed with enthusiasm, there was entire unanimity of spirit; our two million young men sailed blithely away and the rest of us cheered; but when the war was over and it came to making peace, immediately we fell apart and began quarreling: the Senate snarled; the soldiers complained; everybody seemed out of humor."
The young man does not want to be safe.
He wants to take a chance.
He wants to play the game.
"It is for this reason the American people do not take kindly to Socialism, or any other system which proposes to make a man secure in his employment."
"If you were to offer the thousand workmen in your factory a guarantee that each of them could hold his job for the rest of his life, with few exceptions they would reject your proposition."
"Every laborer feels he is a possible manager, owner, millionaire."
One reason why America has been so free from the atmosphere of militarism is that the ways of opportunity are all open.
The soul has not been denied the danger-food it craves.
"When social conditions are fixed, as they are in the old world, and men are held down in the ruts of class, by and by there is an explosion."
Pope Francis’ reported comments to a gay man that “God made you like this” have been embraced by the LGBT community as another sign of Francis’ desire to make gay people feel welcomed and loved in the Catholic Church.
"Juan Carlos Cruz, the main whistleblower in Chile’s clerical sex abuse and cover-up scandal, said Monday he spoke to Francis about his homosexuality during their recent meetings at the Vatican."
"Pope Francis auctions off his blessed Lamborghini Cruz said he told Francis how Chile’s bishops used his sexual orientation as a weapon to try to discredit him, and of the pain the personal attacks had caused him."
"“He said, ‘Look Juan Carlos, the pope loves you this way."
"God made you like this and he loves you,’” Cruz told The Associated Press."
"Official church teaching calls for gay men and lesbians to be respected and loved, but considers homosexual activity “intrinsically disordered”."
"Francis, though, has sought to make the church more welcoming to gays, most famously with his 2013 comment “Who am I to judge?"
"He also has spoken of his own ministry to gay and transgender people, insisting they are children of God, loved by God and deserving of accompaniment by the church."
"In addition, there was a time not so long ago when the Catholic Church officially taught that sexual orientation was not something people choose, the implication being it was how God made them."
"The first edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the dense summary of Catholic teaching published by St. John Paul II in 1992, said gay individuals “do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial”."
"James Martin, a Jesuit whose book “Building a Bridge” called for the church to find new pastoral ways of ministering to gays, noted that the pope’s comments were in a private conversation, not a public pronouncement or document."
"“The pope is saying what every reputable biologist and psychologist will tell you, which is that people do not choose their sexual orientation,” Martin said in a telephone interview."
"When translating phrases from gender-neutral languages including Turkish and Finnish, users noticed that Google gave male pronouns to certain professions, such as police, engineer and leader."
"In contrast, female pronouns were given to jobs including secretary, nanny and nurse."
"The reason for this bias remains unclear, and Google is yet to respond to requests for comment."
But issues with translating gender-netural languages have been noticed by several users this week THE ISSUE Google Translate has been found to favour certain pronouns when translating gender-neutral languages into English.
"For example, when translating Turkish, male pronouns were given to professions including engineers, doctors and soldiers, while female pronouns were assigned to nurse teacher and cook."
"A friend was deemed to be male, while a lover was deemed to be female."
"And someone who was married was given a 'she' pronoun, while someone who was single was given a 'he' pronoun."
But issues with translating gender-netural languages have been noticed by several users this week.
He tweeted: 'Turkish is a gender neutral language.
There is no 'he' or 'she' - everything is just 'o'.
"He also posted a screengrab of various translations from Google Translate, in which the tool had automatically assigned genders to different phrases."
"Male pronouns were given to professions including engineers, doctors and soldiers, while female pronouns were assigned to nurses, teachers and cooks."
"But Google decides, if a job title is good to go with the male or the female English third-person pronoun."
Finnish has a gender neutral third-person pronoun.
"She then posted a list like Mr Shams', with similar results to the Turkish translations."
"Earlier this year, for instance, examples of gender bias started cropping up on social media with Google Translate."
"Try translating terms into English from Turkish, which has gender-neutral pronouns, and a phrase like o bir muhendis becomes he is an engineer, while o bir hemsire translates to she is a nurse."
"Microsoft’s own translation service on Bing has a similar problem, thanks to the use of gender in grammar - think le and la in French, or der and die in German."
"When Bing translates “the table is soft” into German, it offers the feminine die Tabelle, which refers to a table of figures."
"“These gender associations are projected onto objects,” says Kate McCurdy, a senior computational linguist with the language-learning startup Babbel in Berlin, Germany, who discovered the bias in Bing."
“Objects that happen to be grammatically masculine are given masculine properties.
It's learning to take gender stereotypes and project them into the whole world of nouns”.
"By looking at what words tend to be around other words, like “engineer,” the model can be used to figure out what other word fits best, like “he”."
The price of learning from reams of existing text and dialogue is that such models pick up the true-to-life imbalance between genders when it comes to jobs or opportunities.
"A 2016 study that trained word-embedding models on articles on Google showed gender stereotypes “to a disturbing extent,” according to its researchers."
"“The default now is to build these applications and release them into the wild and fight the fires when they come out,” she adds."
There were three women and one man on the panel.
The audience was almost exclusively women.
We talked about the implications of men sculpting women’s insecurities to maximize corporate profits and how even a gender-blind application process isn’t a perfect fix in a society that punishes feminine boldness and confidence.
"Whenever talk turned toward solutions, the panel came back to mentorship: women lifting up other women."
Assertiveness and leaning in and ironclad portfolios and marching into that interview and taking the space you deserve and changing the ratio and not letting Steve from accounting talk over you in the meeting.
"During the closing question-and-answer period, a young woman stood up."
"“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice electric with anger, “but all I’ve heard tonight are a bunch of things women can do to fight sexism."
This audience should be full of men”.
"The sexual abuse scandal currently embroiling media mogul Harvey Weinstein has stunned the United States, with Hollywood and the fashion industry declaring that “this way of treating women ends now”."
"As an Argentinean woman who studies gender in the media, I find it hard to be surprised by Weinstein’s misdeeds."
"Machismo remains deeply ingrained in Latin American society, yes, but even female political leaders in supposedly gender-equal paradises like Holland and Sweden have told me that they are criticized more in the press and held to a higher standard than their male counterparts."
"Women’s work Television commercials are particularly guilty, frequently casting women in subservient domestic roles."
It explains how its concentrated cleaning capsules “made Sleeping Beauty shine”.
"In it, a princess eager to receive her prince remembers that – gasp – the floors in her castle tower are a total mess."
"Thanks to Cif’s magic scouring fluid, she has time not only to clean but also to get dolled up for the prince – who, in case you were wondering, has no physical challenges preventing him from helping her tidy up."
"But why should he, when it’s a woman’s job to be both housekeeper and pretty princess?"
"Somewhat paradoxically, advertisements may also cast men as domestic superheroes."
"Often, characters like Mr. Muscle will mansplain to women about the best product and how to use it – though they don’t actually do any cleaning themselves."
"More recently, there’s been a shift – perhaps an awkward attempt at political correctness – in which women are still the masters of the home, but their partners are shown “helping out” with the chores."
"In exchange, the men earn sex object status."
"We’ve come a little way, baby Various studies on gender stereotypes in commercials indicate that although the advertising industry is slowly changing for the better, marketing continues to target specific products to certain customers based on traditional gender roles."
"Women are pitched hygiene and cleaning products, whereas men get ads for banks, credit cards, housing, cars and other significant financial investments."
The aim of this global campaign is to end stereotypical and sexist portrayals of gender in advertising.
"As part of the ""Unstereotype"" campaign, Unilever also undertook research on gender in advertising."
It found that only 3 percent of advertising shows women as leaders and just 2 percent conveys them as intelligent.
"In ads, women come off as interesting people just 1 percent of the time."
"Britain paves a path Even before it was forced to reckon with allegations that Harvey Weinstein had also harassed women in London, the United Kingdom was making political progress on the issue of women’s portrayal in the media."
"In July, the United Kingdom’s Advertising Standards Authority announced that the U.K. will soon prohibit commercials that promote gender stereotypes."
"“While advertising is only one of many factors that contribute to unequal gender outcomes,” its press release stated, “tougher advertising standards can play an important role in tackling inequalities and improving outcomes for individuals, the economy and society as a whole”."
"As of 2018, the agency says, advertisements in which women are shown as solely responsible for household cleaning or men appear useless around kitchen appliances and unable to handle taking care of their children and dependents will not pass muster in the U.K. Commercials that differentiate between girls’ and boys’ toys based on gender stereotypes will be banned as well."
Sticky floors The U.K.‘s move is a heartening public recognition that gender stereotypes in the media both reflect and further the very real inequalities women face at home and at work.
"Worldwide, the International Labor Organization reports, women still bear the burden of household chores and caretaking responsibilities, which often either excludes them from pay work or leaves them relegated to ill-paid part-time jobs."
"In the U.K., men spend on average 16 hours per week on domestic tasks, while women spend 26."
"The European Union average is worse, with women dedicating an average of 26 weekly hours to men’s nine hours on caretaking and household tasks."
"In Argentina, my home country, fully 40 percent of men report doing no household work at all, even if they’re unemployed."
"Among those who do pitch in, it’s 24 hours a week on caretaking and domestic chores for men."
"You can do the math: On average, Argentinean women use up two days of their week and some 100 days annually – nearly one-third of their year – on unpaid household labor."
"Real-world consequences These inequalities, combined with advertising that reinforces them, generate what’s called the “sticky floors” problem."
"Women – whether would-be investment bankers or, I dare say, aspiring Hollywood stars – don’t just face glass ceilings to advancement, they also are also “stuck” to domestic life by endless chores."
"The cultural powers that be produce content that represents private spaces as “naturally” imbued with female qualities, gluing women to traditional caregiving roles."
This hampers their professional development and helps keep them at the bottom of the economy pyramid because women must pull off a balancing act between their jobs inside and outside of the domestic sphere.
"She, he reminded an audience in 2008, “was doing everything I was doing, but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels”."
"The sticky floor problem puts women in a position to be exploited by men like Weinstein, who tout their ability to help female aspirants to get unstuck."
"Until society – and, with it, the media we create – comprehend that neither professional success nor domesticity has a gender, these pernicious powerful dynamics will endure."
"Many feminist scholars have traced the discursive effects of postfeminism with concern, noting how its ascendency has made sexism difficult to name and to challenge."
"As feminist critiques of persistent, pervasive gender inequalities trickle into media and popular consciousness, we ask whether and how possibilities for identifying and accounting for sexism might be transformed."
We draw from an action-oriented research project that explored whether (and how) feminist ideas offered secondary school students critical purchase on their everyday experiences.
Participants described copious examples of everyday sexism directed at women and girls but very few instances of “sexism” towards men and boys.
"Even so, interviewees often spoke about sexism in ways that prioritised boys' and men's experiences while downplaying sexism towards girls and women."
"In this article we explore how young people made sense of sexism around them, attending to the discursive effects of their talk."
"He was born a member of the Eastern Dakota (or Santee) Sioux tribe in 1858 and dubbed Hakadah, or “pitiful last,” for his mother died in giving birth to him."
"The boy’s father, Many Lightnings, was thought to have been killed by whites during the Dakota War of 1862, and he was raised by his grandmother and uncle in the ways of traditional Sioux life; this included being given a new name when he became a young man: Ohiyesa or “always wins”."
"Before this boy’s life would take a dramatic and unexpected turn, and Ohiyesa would became Eastman, he would nearly complete the Sioux journey from boy to man."
"The elements of this journey contain much wisdom for young men in the present day, and the grown men who wish to see them raised to honorable manhood."
"How a Sioux Boy Became a Man “From childhood I was consciously trained to be a man; that was, after all, the basic thing; but after this I was trained to be a warrior and a hunter, and not to care for money or possessions, but to be in the broadest sense a public servant."
"After arriving at a reverent sense of the pervading presence of the Spirit and Giver of Life, and a deep consciousness of the brotherhood of man, the first thing for me to accomplish was to adapt myself perfectly to natural things — in other words, to harmonize myself with nature."
"To this end I was made to build a body both symmetrical and enduring — a house for the soul to live in — a sturdy house, defying the elements."
The education of a Sioux boy began before he was even born
"While he grew in his mother’s womb, she would choose a model of manhood from among the heroes of the tribe whom she hoped her son would one day emulate."
She would then wander the woods alone and rehearse the valiant deeds of this exemplar to herself and her unborn child.
"As Eastman later recalled, after a boy was born, his family and tribe wasted no time in continuing this natal initiation into the role of man: “Scarcely was the embyro warrior ushered into the world, when he was met by lullabies that speak of wonderful exploits in hunting and war."
"Those ideas which so fully occupied his mother’s mind before his birth are now put into words by all about the child, who is as yet quite unresponsive to their appeals to his honor and ambition."
"He is called the future defender of his people, whose lives may depend upon his courage and skill”."
"During a Sioux boy’s younger years, he was largely raised by his mother."
"In Ohiyesa’s case, his wise grandmother Stands Sacred filled that role."
"As soon as he started crawling around, she began pointing out the names and features of different animals and plants in his environment, developing him into a true “prince of the wilderness”."
The 6 Virtues of Sioux Character Development Stands Sacred also began Ohiyesa’s education in the character traits and virtues he would need in order to one day take his place in the tribe’s circle of men.
"“Silence, love, reverence — this is the trinity of first lessons; and to these she later adds generosity, courage, and chastity”."
"As Eastman explains, the virtue of silence was part of a larger standard of “Indian etiquette”: “No one who is at all acquainted with the Indian in his home can deny that we are a polite people."
"As a rule, the warrior who inspired the greatest terror in the hearts of his enemies was a man of the most exemplary gentleness, and almost feminine refinement, among his family and friends."
"A soft, low voice was considered an excellent thing in man, as well as in woman!"
"Indeed, the enforced intimacy of tent life would soon become intolerable, were it not for these instinctive reserves and delicacies, this unfailing respect for the established place and possessions of every other member of the family circle, this habitual quiet, order, and decorum”."
"The love of a male Sioux did not revolve around a romantic sentimentality, but was rather shown through adherence to service and duty: “Every boy, from the very beginning of his training, is an embryo public servant."
"The finest love a man could develop was for his fellow men; friendship was thought “to be the severest test of character”: “It is easy, we think, to be loyal to family and clan, whose blood is in our own veins."
Love between man and woman is founded on the mating instinct and is not free from desire and self-seeking.
"But to have a friend, and to be true under any and all trials, is the mark of a man!"
The highest type of friendship is the relation of ‘brother-friend’ or ‘life-and-death friend.
"’ This bond is between man and man, is usually formed in early youth, and can only be broken by death."
"It is the essence of comradeship and fraternal love, without thought of pleasure or gain, but rather for moral support and inspiration."
"Each is vowed to die for the other, if need be, and nothing denied the brother-friend, but neither is anything required that is not in accord with the highest conceptions of the Indian mind”."
"All living things were thought to have a soul — not of the same kind as man, but a spirit created by the Maker nonetheless."
Acquisitiveness was thought to weaken one’s manhood and hinder spiritual growth.
"To overcome the attachment to possessions, and maintain a minimal lifestyle, public giving was a prominent part of weddings, births, and funerals, and any other occasion in which a member of the tribe was especially honored."
"During such ceremonies, the Sioux often gave “to the point of utter impoverishment”: “The Indian in his simplicity literally gives away all that he has, to relatives, to guests of another tribe or clan, but above all to the poor and the aged, from whom he can hope for no return."
"The skilled hunter would regularly invite the old men of the tribe to feast with him and his family; in return, the old men entertained and edified the household with their stories of days gone by."
"By showing himself to be a generous host, “his reputation is won as a hunter and a feast-maker, and almost as famous in his way as the great warrior is he who has a recognized name and standing as a ‘man of peace."
The importance of courage to a Sioux is encapsulated in Eastman’s recollection that he had “wished to be a brave man as much as a white boy desires to be a great lawyer or even President of the United States”.
Courage was predicated on the ability to forget oneself in the pursuit of duty and the desire to serve and protect others.
"As Eastman explained: “The Sioux conception of bravery makes of it a high moral virtue, for to him it consists not so much in aggressive self-assertion as in absolute self-control”: “The truly brave man, we contend, yields neither to fear nor anger, desire nor agony; he is at all times master of himself; his courage rises to the heights of chivalry, patriotism, and real heroism."
"‘Let neither cold, hunger, nor pain, nor the fear of them, neither the bristling teeth of danger nor the very jaws of death itself, prevent you from doing a good deed,’ said an old chief to a scout who was about to seek the buffalo in midwinter for the relief of a starving people”."
"Chastity was not only prized in a Sioux woman, but in a Sioux man as well."
Certain feasts were held for the young men that only those boys who had never spoken to a girl in courtship could attend.
Demonstrating one’s worth as a man was considered a prerequisite to making oneself eligible to be a suitor.
"“It was considered ridiculous to do so before attaining some honor as a warrior, and the novices prided themselves greatly upon their self-control”."
"The highest honor went to the man who had “won some distinction in war and the chase, and above all to have been invited to a seat in the council, before one had spoken to any girl save his own sister”."
"Part of the salutatory effect of the vigorous physical training young men participated in was thought to be the way such sports and games served as an outlet for their sexual energy, so that they might maintain a courageous self-mastery in that area of their lives as well."
"An Education in Manhood “The ‘School of Savagery’ is no haphazard thing, but a system of education which has been long in the building, and which produces results."
"Ingenuity, faithfulness, and self-reliance will accomplish wonderful things in civilized life as well as in wild life, but, to my mind, individuality and initiative are more successfully developed in the out-of-door man”."
"When a Sioux boy became a young man, his education was turned over to his father, or in Ohiyesa’s case, his uncle."
"A boy was taught by the men in his tribe how to be a warrior and a hunter, and to understand the tribe’s code of honor."
"A boy’s father would constantly ask him questions about natural phenomena, to see if he could identify certain plants, animal tracks, weather patterns, and so on."
"Eastman recalled his uncle’s regular drilling: “When I left the teepee in the morning, he would say: ‘Hakadah, look closely to everything you see’; and at evening, on my return, he used often to catechize me for an hour or so."
’ It was his custom to let me name all the new birds that I had seen during the day.
"I would name them according to the color or the shape of the bill or their song or the appearance and locality of the nest — in fact, anything about the bird that impressed me as characteristic."
He then usually informed me of the correct name.
Occasionally I made a hit and this he would warmly commend”.
"As an oral culture, Sioux knowledge and traditions were passed down through stories, which boys had to both listen to, and then be prepared to recite themselves."
"It was a highly effective method of “schooling,” as it strengthened a boy’s power of memorization, required him to exercise courage in facing the risk of public performance, sunk the tribe’s philosophy down into his marrow, and inspired him to live up to the heroes of the past: “Very early, the Indian boy assumed the task of preserving and transmitting the legends of his ancestors and his race."
"Almost every evening a myth, or a true story of some deed done in the past, was narrated by one of the parents or grandparents, while the boy listened with parted lips and glistening eyes."
"On the following evening, he was usually required to repeat it."
"If he was not an apt scholar, he struggled long with his task; but, as a rule, the Indian boy is a good listener and has a good memory, so that the stories were tolerably well mastered."
"The household became his audience, by which he was alternately criticized and applauded."
This sort of teaching at once enlightens the boy’s mind and stimulates his ambition.
His conception of his own future career becomes a vivid and irresistible force.
Whatever there is for him to learn must be learned; whatever qualifications are necessary to a truly great man he must seek at any expense of danger and hardship.
Such was the feeling of the imaginative and brave young Indian”.
The greatest method by which Indian boys learned came simply through closely observing and then emulating the other men in the tribe.
Young men were constantly surrounded by mentors — a third family — who together helped raised him.
"These lessons in manliness came directly, but also by tagging along with father and uncles and apprenticing in the tasks of manhood."
"For the Sioux, achievement was a prerequisite to respect, influence, and marriage, and so status-seeking was not a frowned-upon practice; as they believed “that the world was full of natural rivalry,” competition was considered essential in inspiring young men to become their best selves and developing and maintaining a vital, virile manhood."
"Contests were thus greatly encouraged, and were incorporated by boys into nearly everything they did."
We felt very much as our fathers did in hunting and war — each one strove to excel all the others”.
Sports and games — from running races to wrestling matches to attempting to get honey from a hive before being attacked by its producers — were a central and well-enjoyed part of every boy’s life.
"Even hunting became a competition for young men, who “kept strict account of [their] game, and thus learned who were the best shots among the boys”."
"Warfare too was thought of as a kind of sporting competition; “founded upon the principle of manly rivalry,” it was seen as a chance for men to test themselves and gain honor: “Warfare we regarded as an institution — an organized tournament or trial of courage and skill, with elaborate rules and ‘counts’ for the coveted honor of the eagle feather."
"It was held to develop the quality of manliness and its motive was chivalric or patriotic, but never the desire for territorial aggrandizement or the overthrow of a brother nation."
"It was common, in early times, for a battle or skirmish to last all day, with great display of daring and horsemanship with scarcely more killed and wounded than may be carried from the field during a university game of football”."
What makes honor such an effective moral system for shaping behavior is the fact that both failures and successes in living the code bring public consequences — shame for the former and praise for the latter.
"Young men want to be recognized, and they crave the admiration found in a job well done."
"The fact that a Sioux boy was kept “ever before the public eye, from his birth onward” thus inspired him to perform well in his manly pursuits: “His entrance into the world, especially in the case of the first-born, was often publicly announced by the herald, accompanied by a distribution of presents to the old and needy."
"The same thing occurred when he took his first step, when his ears were pierced, and when he shot his first game, so that his childish exploits and progress were known to the whole clan as to a larger family, and he grew into manhood with the saving sense of a reputation to sustain."
"The youth was encouraged to enlist early in the public service, and to develop a wholesome ambition for the honors of a leader and feast maker, which can never be his unless he is truthful and generous, as well as brave, and ever mindful of his personal chastity and honor”."
"Manly honor must be earned, and it can only be earned by those with skin in the game — those who take on risk to gain status."
The Sioux offered warriors different degrees of honors for their valiant deeds — the highest being the eagle feather.
"While other feathers could be worn as decorative ornaments, eagle feathers could not be donned for style; the privilege of wearing these status markers went only to those who had performed deeds on the battlefield that others had clearly witnessed, and which were affirmed by the grand council of war chiefs."
"No man could claim he did something, or was entitled to any honor, without proof, and no man could “wear the honorable insignia of another”."
"Under this system, “No favoritism is possible and the highest degrees are conferred only upon men who have been tried again and again by every conceivable ordeal”."
"The fact that honor goes only to those with skin the game was a lesson Ohiyesa learned well as a boy, when he asked his uncle for the claws of a bear he had hunted and killed: “We dragged the huge carcass within our lodge."
"‘O, what nice claws he has, uncle!"
It is only the old medicine men who wear them regularly.
"The son of a great warrior who has killed a grizzly may wear them upon a public occasion,’ he explained."
‘And you are just like my father and are considered the best hunter among the Santees and Sissetons.
"‘My boy, you shall have them,’ he said, ‘but it is always better to earn them yourself."
"Finding Manhood in Solitude As Ohiyesa approached the age of 16, he had participated in all of his tribe’s activities “except that of war, and was nearly old enough to be initiated into the ritual of the war-path”."
"To prepare himself to finally attain the rank of warrior, Ohiyesa did what all the young men were encouraged to do: take to the woods alone."
"In solitude, the man-in-the-making contemplated the spirit of nature, invoked the blessing of the Great Mystery, and sought to let the boyhood lessons he’d received in virtue and honor sink deep into his bones."
"During this time, Ohiyesa’s closest companions were his horse and dog and his “people saw very little of [him] during the day”: “for in solitude I found the strength I needed."
"I groped about in the wilderness, and determined to assume my position as a man."
"My boyish ways were departing, and a sullen dignity and composure was taking their place."
The thought of love did not hinder my ambitions.
"I had a vague dream of some day courting a pretty maiden, after I had made my reputation, and won the eagle feathers… In this wild, rolling country I rapidly matured, and laid, as I supposed, the foundations of my life career, never dreaming of anything beyond this manful and honest, unhampered existence”."
From Deep Woods to Civilization “Such are the beliefs in which I was reared — the secret ideals which have nourished in the American Indian a unique character among the peoples of the earth.
"Its simplicity, its reverence, its bravery and uprightness must be left to make their own appeal to the American of today, who is the inheritor of our homes, our names, and our traditions."
"Since there is nothing left us but remembrance, at least let that remembrance be just!"
"Though Ohiyesa looked forward to becoming a warrior, and avenging the death of his father, the well-laid plans of his youth, and the entire life he had known for a decade and a half, were soon turned upside down."
"In 1872, his father — alive and well — wandered back into his tribe’s camp."
"Many Lightnings had not been killed after all, but rather forced to flee to the Dakota Territory, where he had converted to Christianity, changed his name to Jacob Eastman, and established a homestead."
"Eastman had to come to believe that his fellow Indians needed to adapt to the fast-encroaching ways of civilization, and thus strongly desired that his son become educated and learn the culture of the white man."
"As Eastman unfolded to his son the wondrous inventions of civilization and the tenets of his new faith, Ohiyesa was filled with both “admiration and indignation” and had to fight down a voice within him which cried, “A false life!"
"” Yet from a mixture of curiosity and filial obedience, he agreed to follow his father away from the Sioux village, away from the open plains and sky, away from the only life he had ever known, and onto a mysterious and wholly new path."
"In the years to come, the young man experienced a bewildering clash of cultures."
He cut his hair and changed his clothes.
He converted to Christianity and changed his name for yet the third time to Charles Alexander Eastman.
"He learned to live indoors more often than out, and to spend much of that time within the four-walls of a classroom."
"Eastman’s education transformed from sitting at his elders’ knees, and learning the signs of nature and the symbols of his tribe, to sitting at a desk and learning the signs of arithmetic and the symbols of the English alphabet."
"Yet Eastman’s curiosity and intelligence won him success in this new and foreign endeavor, and after attending a series of preparatory schools, he earned his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College and graduated from the medical school at Boston College — becoming one of the first American Indians certified as a European-style doctor."
Eastman went on to serve as a government-appointed physician at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota (he tended to victims of the Wounded Knee massacre while there) and a tireless spokesman and advocate for the rights and autonomy of his people.
"He also became a renowned author, writing many books about the culture of Plains Indians before the coming of the white man."
"Eastman was aggravated and dismayed that many of his contemporaries’ stereotypes of Indians — that his people were barbarous, drunken, dishonest, and immoral — were rooted in behaviors that had arisen after, and as a consequence of, the arrival of European settlers."
He wished to educate the American people about Indian life as he had known it — the true ideals and ways of the Sioux — as he felt that the contact between the cultures needn’t be a one-way street; that whites had as much to learn from the native peoples as the natives had to learn from whites.
"Eastman not only shared this message in his books and his lectures, but sought to put it into practice."
"He played an integral role in helping to develop and found Indian divisions of the YMCA, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Camp Fire Girls, as well as the summer camps of these organizations."
"He earnestly desired for Indian and non-Indian youth alike to experience the satisfaction of learning the art of woodcraft and the joy of immersing themselves in the spiritual power of nature — to receive, at least in part, the kind of “open-air education” he had gotten as a boy."
"The fact that Eastman had grown up a Sioux, and then gone on to earn advanced degrees, made him a unique figure, and uniquely suited to acting as a bridge between the country’s native peoples and its new arrivals."
"He found much disheartening about white civilization, but much that was worthy as well, and he tried to wed the best of both of his worlds together."
"From this vantage point, he was able to powerfully convey the philosophy and traditions of the Sioux in a way in which non-Indians could readily feel their own lack of those ideals, and how their adaption into modern culture could greatly enhance their lives."
His words continue to have this power today.
"As such, in the coming weeks we’ll offer a series of edited collections of Eastman’s wisdom on three elements of American Indian wisdom that each deserve their own article."
"Though he’s been called the greatest combat general of modern times, George S. Patton didn’t feel like a natural born leader."
"In fact, as a boy he was rather sensitive, timid, and mild in disposition, and thought himself deficient in the military virtues."
"But becoming a courageous, inspiring, tough-as-nails commander was the great desire of his heart, and so Patton trained himself to develop the qualities he lacked."
"He exercised his body to the point he could compete as an Olympic pentathlete, voraciously studied the tactics of militaries from every time and culture, practiced martial skills until he had mastered them, and volunteered for dangerous assignments to get comfortable under fire."
"By dint of an ironclad will, Patton not only overcame his innate proclivities, but learned to outwardly project his inner sense of determination."
A man of diffident manner will never inspire confidence.
"It then appears that the leader must be an actor, and such is the fact."
He is unconvincing unless he lives his part.
"Though Patton presented himself as supremely confident, that didn’t mean he never again felt fear; just that he didn’t let it control him."
"As he observed, “All men are timid on entering any fight; whether it is the first fight or the last fight all of us are timid."
Cowards are those who let their timidity get the better of their manhood.
"Many of the greatest men of history have stories similar to Patton’s: they made of themselves what they wished, even when their innate dispositions pulled them in a different direction, and they became leaders who acted with composure, despite their own feelings of uncertainty."
"Theodore Roosevelt was famously a boy of great timidity and ill health before he decided to “make his body;” he spent the rest of his life trying to prove he was a man of great bravery and vitality, who could endure all the challenges of living strenuously “in the arena”."
"His stated approach to conquering his weaknesses paralleled Patton’s: “There were all kinds of things I was afraid of at first, ranging from grizzly bears to ‘mean’ horses and gun-fighters; but by acting as if I was not afraid I gradually ceased to be afraid”."
"Winston Churchill was a sensitive, unathletic lad who deliberately transformed himself into the “Bulldog” of England and led his country through their “darkest hour”."
"Churchill’s spirit of resolution not only helped win the war, but perhaps just as importantly, made his fellow Englishmen believe they would win the war."
"He was not only able to form an inner conviction to never surrender, he was able to convey that assurance to others – to be the face of indomitability and act the part of the supremely confident leader; as his daughter Mary put it, even though his challenges were monumental, and he was prone to his own bouts of doubt, frustration, and melancholy, Churchill’s setbacks never “un-manned him”."
"General Dwight D. Eisenhower also had times during the war when he felt beat-down, irritated, and demoralized, but he similarly refused to let his men see that."
"Instead, no matter what he was feeling inwardly, he outwardly projected a farm-boy friendliness and an easy, comforting confidence: “I firmly determined that my mannerisms and speech in public would always reflect the cheerful certainty of victory—that any pessimism and discouragement I might ever feel would be reserved for my pillow."
"To translate this conviction into tangible results, I adopted a policy of circulating through the whole force to the full limit imposed by physical considerations."
"I did my best to meet everyone from general to private with a smile, a pat on the back, and a definite interest in his problems."
"These men (and the list of further examples would be endless) found success, lived with greatness, and left a legacy not by “being themselves” — at least not in the way we understand that injunction these days."
"They were not “true to themselves,” at least not to certain parts of who they were."
"Rather, they embraced a role, they acted a part — they wore a mask."
And we’re all the better for it.
"Examining the Moderns Attacks on the Masks of Masculinity In the last several years, there are have been books, articles, and documentaries put out deriding the so-called “masks of masculinity”."
"The argument forwarded is that men are damaged by the injunction to “be a man” and by being forced into a role where they have to act tough, aggressive, stoic, and like they have everything under control."
They can’t be themselves.
They can’t give full expression to their emotions.
"They are trapped by the masks they must wear, and these masks are not only metaphorically and literally killing them, they create a “toxic masculinity” that wreaks havoc on society."
"If men would take off their masks, this line of thinking goes, they would not only individually find more success and happiness, but the whole world would benefit as well."
"This is in fact one of the arguments made for why men should embrace feminism — that patriarchy holds men back as well as women, and men should want to be liberated from the male “stereotypes” that keep them ensnared."
"It’s all a very compelling narrative to be sure — but the argument relies on many unexamined assumptions, which, once unpacked, reveal numerous contradictions and logical inconsistencies."
"One of the underlying assumptions behind the argument against the “masks of masculinity” is that masks are bad because they are artificially created and imposed, while feelings are more pure and authentic and emanate from one’s “real” self."
"Rather than being something that can be objectively proven, this is, of course, a philosophical argument — one that involves the very tricky question of what constitutes the “self” — and a counterargument to its premise can be forwarded on a couple of fronts."
"First, to what extent are feelings truly “native” to ourselves?"
"Perhaps half of our personality was baked right into our DNA and present at birth, so surely, yes, many of our feelings might be considered intrinsically “us”."
But what about the other half of how we turn out?
"Since we were babes, we’ve been bombarded with millions of advertisements and media messages."
"Who we are has been shaped by our parents, our peers, and our experiences."
"If all of these external and “artificial” influences have molded our feelings, are they any more authentic than the other kinds of masks we wear?"
"Second, should we really privilege and trust all our feelings?"
"What if I feel like punching an annoying person in the face, should I heed that urge?"
"If I want to stare at an attractive woman’s breasts, should I give in to that impulse?"
Critics of the masks of masculinity would of course answer these questions in the negative.
"In fact, in regards to those latter two, they would say that the urge to be violent or sexually aggressive is actually just another mask, rather than an authentic feeling (despite the fact there is ample scientific evidence that proves the innate, biological origin of the male drive for dominance)."
"Because what they really mean when they say men need to get in touch with their feelings, is that they need to get in touch with their “nice” feelings — feelings that lead them to be more sensitive and vulnerable and gentle like women."
"But it’s logically inconsistent to say that masks are bad because they stifle your feelings, which represent your true self and must be accessed and liberated, but then to only apply that precept to some feelings and not to others."
"The truth is that while feelings are important, nobody — whether man or woman — is well served by privileging them over other aspects of the self, like rational thought and volitional desires."
Masks in fact provide the thin veneer between barbarism and civility that keeps the world spinning round.
"People complain that the masks of violence and sexual aggression are what cause some men to behave badly, when it fact it is the mask of civility which keeps most men from acting out."
"Masks are then no better or worse, nor more or less authentic, than our feelings."
"The specific “masks of masculinity” are masks of toughness, strength, competence, self-reliance, stoicism etc."
"These masks are destructively stifling and prevent men from becoming their true, fully fulfilled selves."
But then we’re back again to the question of how to define one’s “true self” in the first place.
"When Patton and TR felt fear, but acted courageously anyway, was the fear their real self, or was the courage?"
"When Churchill and Ike felt discouraged, but decided to act confident and composed anyway, was the discouragement their real self, or was the confident composure?"
"A stronger argument could be made that the men’s volitional action was more real, more “true” than their reflexive emotions."
"Further, their masks enabled them to act in the way they wanted to; rather than being stifling, the masks were liberating – they empowered these men to be who they desired to be."
"They can enable you to be and act the way you want to, in line with not just your innate feelings, but your highest, deliberately chosen ideals."
"Indeed, roles aren’t such a bad thing."
"When a solider or police officer runs towards danger instead of away from it, it’s not because they don’t feel fear; it’s because the mask of their role — their uniform and mantle — helps them push past the fear and do their job."
"When you’re nervous walking into a pitch meeting, stepping into the role of successful, confident entrepreneur allows you to ace the interaction."
"When someone’s messing with your family, embracing the role of the strong patriarch can enable you to stand up for them."
But what if a man doesn’t like the stereotypical role of masculinity?
Doesn’t feel like he fits into such masks?
"Well, this might not be popular advice, but he ought to suck it up and still try to wear them."
"These masks aren’t morally neutral; they’re superior values and keys to living a virtuous life (and this is true for both men and women alike, though there is more emphasis on men embracing them for reasons I’ll explain below)."
"Who, whether man or woman, would want to be fragile rather than tough, weak rather than strong, incompetent rather than competent, frenzied rather than stoic, dependent rather than self-reliant, cowardly rather than brave?"
"Within the rubric of being tough, strong, competent, independent, and courageous, there is plenty of room for variations in personality and being who you are; such masks hardly create homogeneous clones."
So let’s not get so relativistic that we say a man shouldn’t strive to live these virtues because it isn’t “him”.
"So maybe masks can empower men to take risks, to act bravely, and to lead others."
But don’t they also push men to behave badly?
"To flee from intimacy, be homophobic, compete in destructive ways, and suppress their emotions?"
"If that were true, then over the last forty years, as there’s been a continual push for men to take off their masks, men should have become much more courteous, open, vulnerable, and sensitive than they were in archaic times past."
"In some ways, they have; yet in others they’ve actually moved in the very opposite direction."
"While we like to think of history as having a continuous progressive arc, the men of today are in fact more emotionally restrained in some ways than men of the past, when the pressure to adhere to the code of manhood was stronger."
"Go back to the 19th century, for example, the last time the traditional code of manhood was fully in place ."
Though the injunction to be a man!
"Victorian men emphasized fair play and good sportsmanship on and off the field, purposefully read sad poetry in order to give themselves over to a good cry, wrote florid love letters to their ladies, and not only referred to male buddies as “bosom friends” but expressed physical intimacy with them in ways that would in fact make most modern men rather uncomfortable."
"How can it be that men today could in some ways be more repressed than the men of the past, given that we’ve spent the last several decades dismissing and dismantling the validity of traditional notions of masculinity?"
"What society formerly understood, and what we fail to understand today, is that not only can men being open, emotional, and decorous exist right alongside a code of manhood that asks them to be strong and stoic, the latter in fact enables the former."
"That is, when men are given outlets for their natural masculine proclivities, asked to adopt noble aims in their behavior, and then celebrated and appreciated for the sacrifices living virtuously entails, they feel secure in their manhood, enough to truly be sensitive and let down their guard from time to time."
"If you feel the whole idea of men needing to be secure in their manhood is silly, because the whole idea of manhood is silly and entirely culturally relative, I would refer you to this series, in which we detail at length the evidence that the desire to “become men” is both deeply biological and universal to every culture, time, and place."
"For two thousand years, the code of manhood in fact required men to embrace both action and contemplation, to be both hard and soft."
"Today, in contrast, boys and men are told that masculinity is silly and artificial and toxic, and are given no clear definition on what manhood even means, nor guidance on how to attain it."
Yet they still feel the desire to become men.
"In this vacuum, in which males want to be men, but don’t know what that means, they grab at masculinity in its most stereotypical forms."
"With all the nuance of manliness having been stripped out over the years, all that is left is macho/alpha traits in cartoonish form."
"Such traits need balancing with softer virtues, but because young men, the bravado of their efforts notwithstanding, aren’t recognized and affirmed as men by mentors and society as a whole, and thus don’t ultimately feel secure in their manhood, these softer virtues are spurned and seen as a threat to their masculinity."
"Which only makes the more stereotypical masculinity they’re struggling to put on become more brittle, one-dimensional, and potentially destructive."
"In short, toxic masculinity isn’t caused by the masks required by the traditional code of manhood, but by deterioration of the code in its fullest form."
Those who decry the masks of masculinity rarely dig into or explain why these masks developed in the first place
"There’s a vague implicit sense that they were just created by the patriarchy to subjugate women, or something, and now are outdated and irrelevant."
But the masks of masculinity did in fact develop for some really important reasons.
"In primitive times, for reasons of biology – males are on average physically stronger than women and more expendable"
Sperm is more plentiful and less valuable than wombs
"In such endeavors, men could not afford to break down or goof up; to do so would put not only their lives but the lives of their comrades in danger."
"Primitive women had to be pretty tough, strong, and resilient too, but because of this division of duties, more emphasis was placed on men developing these qualities."
"Keep in mind that the masks of masculinity were typically not designed to suppress all emotions, all the time, but rather to enable a man to vent his emotions at a time of his choosing – one in which it would not be tactically disadvantageous or put his tribe in danger."
"It wasn’t that you could never cry or be sad, you simply couldn’t afford to emotionally collapse on the battlefield, and so had to be able to turn off those feelings and be tough when the situation called for it."
"Remember that scene in Saving Private Ryan when Mellish is about to be stabbed, and Upham is coming up the stairs and can save his comrade, but he freezes and fails him?"
"Even if a part of you understood he was shell-shocked and felt empathetic for what he was going through, his inaction still probably made you feel incredibly angry and frustrated."
That visceral reaction really captures the deep way we still value the ancient masks of masculinity.
"Now that society is relatively peaceful and food and resources are easy to come by, does that mean that the masks of masculinity are obsolete and unnecessary – that they’re mismatched with our current reality and can thus be entirely thrown out?"
"The masks of masculinity continue to be what enable men to take risks, if less predominantly on the battlefield, then in the marketplace."
"The desire to compete, to gain status, surely does come with some ill effects sometimes, but it’s also what always has and will continue to drive innovation and the advancements of civilization."
"And while physical dangers are certainly more scarce these days, they haven’t disappeared altogether, and a division of duties between the sexes concerning emotional continence still continues to be needed at times."
"No matter how egalitarian someone is in their views, when the s**t hits the fan, men are still expected to lead and protect."
"When stories of heroism emerge from mass shootings, like the recent one in Las Vegas, one always hears about boyfriends and husbands shielding their girlfriends and wives from bullets and carrying them to safety, sometimes at the expense of the men’s lives."
"The story is never, “The wife took a bullet for her husband”."
"In the chaos of such emergencies, we expect that men will be scared, but will have the emotional wherewithal – made by possible by the mask of stoicism and courage — to hold themselves together."
"If they do not, then people — again, no matter how egalitarian their views — are disgusted; remember the consternation over the man who fled the Aurora movie theater shooting, leaving his fiancée and two small children behind?"
"The mask of masculinity is not only needed in such exceptional situations, but when families face more common sorrows."
"When Kate lost our baby when she was five months pregnant, both of us experienced enormous grief."
"Kate was naturally a wreck, and I wanted to allow her to fully grieve the loss."
"I took care of the things that needed doing, so she could be free to fall apart."
"Months later, when she was feeling stronger and felt able to re-shoulder some tasks, I finally allowed myself to really grieve."
"We took turns grieving in a way, and she went first, because of the old-school, supposedly outdated masks of masculinity."
"Kate remains deeply, profoundly grateful for that act, and cried as she read this, saying, “That was one of the greatest expressions of love I’ve ever experienced”."
"Masks don’t always stifle expressions of love, they can in fact liberate them; they can be the vehicle that propagates a distinctly masculine form of nurturing."
"There are still times when a division of duties between the sexes is needed, when someone has to be the protected and someone has to be the protector."
"In a crisis, there’s no time to decide who’s going to take which role."
"In a period of grief, it is still a noble thing for a man to step up and act as the rock for his family."
"Today, we tend to live within an ethos of authenticity."
We tend to believe that the ‘true self’ is whatever is most natural and untutored.
"That is, each of us has a certain sincere way of being in the world, and we should live our life being truthful to that authentic inner self, not succumbing to the pressures outside ourself."
"To live artificially, with a gap between your inner nature and your outer conduct, is to be deceptive, cunning, and false."
Eisenhower hewed to a different philosophy.
This code held that artifice is man’s nature.
"We start out with raw material, some good, some bad, and this nature has to be pruned, girdled, formed, repressed, molded, and often restrained, rather than paraded in public."
A personality is a product of cultivation.
"The true self is what you have built from your nature, not just what your nature started out with”."
"Some today have called for men to remove their masks, claiming that the injunction to be strong, stoic, courageous, competitive, competent, and self-reliant stifles men’s ability to be their true selves and leads to the dissemination of “toxic masculinity”."
"But masks themselves don’t cause toxic masculinity; in fact, masks are precisely what keep it in check."
"The problem is not the masks men wear, but that in recent times, they haven’t been coupled with another: the mask of decorum, self-restraint, and civility."
"Put another way, when men behave badly, the problem isn’t the masks created by the traditional code of manhood, but that the anemic state of the code in modern times has deprived these traditional masks from being molded with proper balance and nuance; the problem is not the existence of the masks themselves, but the way their shape has become distorted."
Why wouldn’t you want to be brave and composed?
"Why wouldn’t you want to be able to give vent to your emotions at a time and place of your choosing, rather than being subject to their whims?"
There isn’t a right or wrong way to do feelings or intimacy.
The traditional feminine forms should not be privileged over the traditionally masculine.
"The world needs protective, masculine nurturance as much as any other form of love."
"The paradox of masks is that though they are “artificial,” they can bring out our truest self — the self which we not only feel ourselves to be, but that which we desire ourselves to be."
"What is more inspiring than the fact that our feelings are not our destiny — that we may feel weak, lazy, and cowardly, but make ourselves into men of strength, conviction, and courage?"
"Used the right way, the masks of masculinity empower the individual and are good for society."
Masks are what allowed Patton and TR to become the leaders they wanted to be.
Masks are what helped Churchill and Ike win a world war.
The masks of masculinity are what help keep the world spinning round.
"And an unhealthy diet—high in processed and refined foods—increases the risk for the disease in everyone, including children and teens."
"Researchers, led by epidemiologist Felice Jacka of Australia’s Deakin University, looked at whether improving the diets of people with major depression would help improve their mood."
"They chose 67 people with depression for the study, some of whom were already being treated with antidepressants, some with psychotherapy, and some with both."
"Half of these people were given nutritional counseling from a dietitian, who helped them eat healthier."
Half were given one-on-one social support—they were paired with someone to chat or play cards with—which is known to help people with depression.
"After 12 weeks, the people who improved their diets showed significantly happier moods than those who received social support."
And the people who improved their diets the most improved the most.
"And later this month in Los Angeles at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting, researchers from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago will present results from their research that shows that elderly adults who eat vegetables, fruits and whole grains are less likely to develop depression over time."
Dr. Jacka helped to found the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research in 2013.
"She’s also launched Deakin University’s Food & Mood Centre, which is dedicated to researching and developing nutrition-based strategies for brain disorders."
"And some medical schools, including Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, are starting to teach psychiatry residents about the importance of diet on mental health."
"But it’s really about an unhealthy brain, and too often people forget this."
"“When we think of cardiac health, we think of strengthening an organ, the heart,” says Drew Ramsey, a psychiatrist in New York, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia and author of “Eat Complete”."
"A bad diet makes depression worse, failing to provide the brain with the variety of nutrients it needs, Dr. Ramsey says."
"They make molecules that can alter the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter found in the brain, says Lisa Mosconi, a neuroscientist, nutritionist and associate director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York."
"The good and bad bacteria in our gut have complex ways to communicate with our brain and change our mood, she says."
"We know that your brain needs nutrients,” Dr. Ramsey says."
Keep in mind that this is only one person’s experience with switching to a healthy diet.
She suffered from depression for decades.
"She tried multiple antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, but found little relief from symptoms including insomnia, crying jags and feelings of hopelessness."
"About five years ago, after her doctor wanted to prescribe yet another antidepressant, she refused the medicine and decided to look for alternative treatments."
Ms. Go began researching depression and learned about the importance of diet.
"She ditched processed and fried foods, sugar and diet sodas."
"In their place, she started to eat primarily vegetables and fruits, eggs, turkey and a lot of tofu."
She bought a Vitamix blender and started making a smoothie with greens for breakfast each morning.
"Within a few months, Ms. Go says she noticed a difference in her mood."
She stopped crying all the time.
Her insomnia went away and she had more energy.
"She also began enjoying activities again that she had given up when she was depressed, such as browsing in bookstores and volunteering at the animal shelter."
Ms. Go’s depression has never come back.
"“This works so well,” she says."
“How come nobody else talks about this?
People headed to the polls on Election Day in Minnesota have two things to think about — how to vote and what to wear.
"While all states outlaw electioneering at the polls, Minnesota and a handful of others go further, prohibiting clothes or buttons that mention not only a candidate, a political party or a ballot issue, but also any group with recognizable political views, such as the Tea Party or MoveOn."
"When Andrew Cilek showed up to vote in 2010 wearing a “Don’t Tread on Me” t-shirt [with a small Tea Party logo] and a button that said “Please I.D. Me,” he was told to cover them up or take them off before he could cast a ballot."
He was finally allowed to vote after a poll worker took down his name and address for possible prosecution.
"When he and other Minnesotans sued, lower courts upheld the law as a reasonable way to preserve decorum at the polls."
"In appealing to the Supreme Court, the challengers say the law goes too far, restricting “The most peaceful method of political expression – the silent wearing of clothing,” including T-shirts that merely name a political group or ideology and make no attempt to persuade voters."
"The ACLU agreed, arguing that the electorate “is surely hardy enough to vote their conscience,” even if they see a Black Lives Matter shirt or a Women’s March hat [or a “Don’t tread on me” t-shirt]."
Minnesota urges the court to uphold the restrictions as necessary to preserve order and decorum at the polls and prevent voter confusion and intimidation.
"“The right to vote and the integrity of our elections must be jealously protected, said Daniel Rogan of the county attorney’s office in Hennepin County, Minnesota."
"Minnesota says they are government-controlled properties, allowing states to impose more restrictions on expression that would be allowed in, for example, a public park."
"The National Association of Counties and other local government groups, in a friend-of-court brief, say delays and fights on Election Day remain common."
The court will issue a decision in the case by the end of June.
"Among the defendants in the case is Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who said he believes Cilek is overreacting."
"He said, “My sense of the First Amendment is not offended by saying, ‘Tea Party folks, don’t wear your “I.D. me please” buttons into the polling place."
I’d like to be left alone when I go to vote.
"The ban broadly prohibits any material “designed to influence and impact voting,” or “promoting a group with recognizable political views,” even when the apparel makes no reference to any issue or candidate on the ballot."
"First, the Justices get together to decide if a case is worthy of being brought before the Court."
"Therefore, the Court tries to use this enormous power only when a case presents a pressing constitutional issue."
At least four Justices have selected the case as being of such importance that the Supreme Court must resolve the legal issues.
An attorney for each side of a case will have an opportunity to make a presentation to the Court and answer questions posed by the Justices.
Prior to the argument each side has submitted a legal brief – a written legal argument outlining each party’s points of law.
"The Justices have read these briefs prior to argument and are thoroughly familiar with the case, its facts, and the legal positions that each party is advocating."
"Beginning the first Monday in October, the Court generally hears two one-hour arguments a day, at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., with occasional afternoon sessions scheduled as necessary."
"In the recesses between argument sessions, the Justices are busy writing opinions, deciding which cases to hear in the future, and reading the briefs for the next argument session."
"They grant review in approximately 100 of the more than 10,000 petitions filed with the Court each term."
"During an argument week, the Justices meet in a private conference, closed even to staff, to discuss the cases and to take a preliminary vote on each case."
"If the Chief Justice is in the majority on a case decision, he decides who will write the opinion."
He may decide to write it himself or he may assign that duty to any other Justice in the majority.
"If the Chief Justice is in the minority, the Justice in the majority who has the most seniority assumes the assignment duty."
When Republican Senator Ted Cruz addressed Mark Zuckerberg he said: “There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.
"I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place”."
"In your testimony you say you have 15,000 to 20,000 people working on security and content review."
"Do you know the political orientation of those 15,000 to 20,000 people engaged in content review?"
"No, we do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they’re joining the company."
"During the hearing in Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he would like to use artificial intelligence tools to monitor and ban hate speech on the platform."
Zuckerberg can’t explain what it is.
"During a separate Congressional meeting, Republican Senator Tim Scott discusses Facebook’s treatment of Diamond and Silk."
"He says in part, “Facebook support of freedom of speech seems to only include liberal speech."
"Now, some people might say that Facebook is a private company and that’s true but Facebook is no ordinary tech company."
"Approximately two-thirds of Americans (66%) use Facebook, and a majority of those users get news on the site."
"Looked at as a portion of all U.S. adults, this translates into just under half (45%) of Americans getting news on Facebook."
"The Pew poll explains: overall, Facebook outstrips all other social media sites as a source of news; YouTube now reaches second highest percentage, with Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit and Tumblr following."
Many Americans (and more young people than older) get their news solely from social media.
How might this affect their outlook on the issues?
"The second story was not a direct response to the first, which is to say the journalists didn’t applaud Mrs. Clinton’s call to hold her accountable."
"According to a Time [magazine] transcript, they applauded her eight times in all; National Review has a video montage."
"And when I left, I had a 66% approval rating."
"Mrs. Clinton’s appearance, at a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists, was described after the fact as a news conference, though it was really something of a hybrid [combination] with a campaign rally."
She took seven questions.
The biggest news to come out of the Q&A portion came when NBC’s Kristin Welker asked Mrs. Clinton about her latest evasion in the classified email scandal.
"She prefaced a long, rambling answer with a vivid quote regarding the false answer she gave Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday”: “I may have short-circuited it”."
"The Hill reports: “Before [Mrs.] Clinton’s appearance, conference staffers went around the room reminding people that it’s inappropriate for journalists to give politicians standing ovations”."
So was she speaking to journalists or to supporters of her candidacy?
"In [August 2016] he raises the following question: If you’re a working journalist and you believe that Donald J. Trump is a demagogue playing to the nation’s worst racist and nationalistic tendencies, that he cozies up to anti-American dictators and that he would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes, how the heck are you supposed to cover him?"
"If you have such a strong opinion about one of the major candidates, perhaps you shouldn’t be reporting on the election."
"You could request a transfer to another beat, or to the opinion section."
"If you really feel strongly about preventing Trump’s election, perhaps you should consider a career change."
"You could go to work for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, or for one of the many independent advocacy organizations that support it."
Rutenberg never considers these possibilities.
"Instead, he wants to bring the mountain to Muhammad: If you believe all of those things, you have to throw out the textbook American journalism has been using for the better part of the past half-century, if not longer, and approach it in a way you’ve never approached anything in your career."
"If you view a Trump presidency as something that’s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that."
You would move closer than you’ve ever been to being oppositional.
"That’s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, nonopinion journalist I’ve ever known, and by normal standards, untenable."
He notes that Trump and his backers “are reprising longstanding accusations of liberal bias [by the media]”.
He writes: A lot of core Trump supporters certainly view it that way.
"That will only serve to worsen their already dim view of the news media, which initially failed to recognize the power of their grievances, and therefore failed to recognize the seriousness of Mr. Trump’s candidacy."
"Is Rutenberg claiming that journalists – who, whatever their biases, have heretofore maintained at least the pretense of fairness and balance – have never taken a candidate seriously before?"
Or that they are not taking Mrs. Clinton seriously?
Another way of putting the media-bias complaint is that conservatives – including some who oppose Trump – have long seen the media as tilting toward the Democratic Party and taking an “oppositional” posture toward Republicans.
Rutenberg is recommending that they dispense with the veneer and embrace open partisanship [bias].
"He doesn’t put it that way, of course."
"He tries to justify his proposed departure from journalistic standards with an appeal to journalistic ideals: Not to treat Trump differently from other candidates, he argues, would “be an abdication of political journalism’s most solemn duty: to ferret out what the candidates will be like in the most powerful office in the world”."
"If that is the case, then what they are ferreting out is facts that reinforce their preconceptions, and that they hope will persuade voters to cast ballots against Trump."
"That’s called “opposition research,” and it is a job for campaign operatives, not journalists."
Rutenberg acknowledges that the approach he recommends “is more than just a shock to the journalistic system.
"It threatens to throw the advantage to [Trump’s] news conference-averse opponent, Hillary Clinton, who should draw plenty more tough-minded coverage herself”."
The greater threat from the abandonment of journalistic standards is that it compounds the danger to the country if Mrs. Clinton is elected.
"They would be mere servants of power, to an even greater extent than they have been for the past 7½ years."
"On Thursday, Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel posted a video under the title “The Dark Art of Political Intimidation."
It is a discourse on the First Amendment and the tactics that progressives are using to limit speech and political engagement by conservatives”.
"Within several hours of PragerU posting the video, YouTube placed it in ‘restricted mode,’ making it inaccessible to schools, libraries and young Americans whose parents have enabled YouTube technology filters."
"Conservative radio host Dennis Prager’s idea for PragerU is to give students alternative, non-progressive takes on history, civics and other issues."
YouTube told the WSJ that “video restrictions are decided by an ‘algorithm’ that factors in ‘community flagging’ and ‘sensitive content.
"In a Sunday statement, YouTube said that its “system looks at a number of factors over time,” and that “content offering may change as a result of additional evaluation by our algorithms”."
America’s social-media platforms are getting a reputation this election season for censoring conservatives.
"They can run their businesses as they choose, but the rest of us can also treat YouTube’s claim of supporting free expression with the skepticism it deserves."
"It was reported in April that Google and its affiliates have attended meetings at the White House 427 times – more than once a week, on average – since President Barack Obama took office."

A British model who was kidnapped and held for ransom in Italy said justice had been “served” on Monday after her kidnapper was sentenced to nearly 17 years in prison.
Chloe Ayling thanked those who “believed in me from the beginning” in a nude Instagram post hours after Lukasz Herba was convicted of kidnapping charges by an Italian court.
"“Shame on all of the ignorant people who doubted what had happened to me and think they know more than the Italian authorities,” Ayling wrote."
"Herba, 30, was accused of drugged and kidnapped Ayling when she showed up at a Milan address for a modeling job."
"He held her for six days at a Piedmont farmhouse before she was released at the British consulate in Milan, according to prosecutors."
Herba testified that Ayling agreed to stage the kidnapping to further her career and that he invented a group used for deep web auctions of women.
"Herba said he made up the Black Death group, which he claimed was behind the kidnapping and deep-web auctions of women, and a series of Romanian co-conspirators."
"Adrian Sington, Ayling’s agent, told Sky News that his client was “over the moon by the verdict”."
"“Her career has been hugely affected by this, we've turned down paid modelling deals since her kidnap and she feels she can no longer work in the industry as she has lost all trust in that world,” he said."
"On Monday at London Fashion Week, all eyes were on the ""pregnant"" male models who strutted down the runway in Chinese designer Xander Zhou’s clothing."
"The male models at Zhou's show sported prosthetic baby bumps under their looks, though some of their bellies saw the spotlight more than others."
"Those whose ""pregnant"" stomachs were covered by shirts, however, clutched their bumps in order to highlight the theme of the show, while another wore a white t-shirt reading, ""New World Baby""."
"Zhou later explained his odd choice, of having the male models appear pregnant, on Instagram."
"“At Supernatural, Extraterrestrial & Co., we’re prepared to welcome a future of male pregnancy,” the post read."
"Aside from the pregnant models, Zhou's show also featured a man wearing a trenchcoat with six arms, giving it the appearance of an arm-supported umbrella."

"He says the impersonator showered them with compliments, lured them into a long-distance relationship and wooed them with offers of marriage to win their hearts."
"Then, in chats over Facebook Messenger, the fraudster spun lies about being injured in combat and his children back home being sick and asked them to send him money."
"Lovato, who is married to 42-year-old landlord Jane Hamilton, was oblivious to the havoc being wreaked in his name until strangers began messaging him online early last year."
"One claimed to be in love with him, another scolded him for breaking her heart, and a third revealed she had sent the man she believed to him a sum of money."
"In total Lovato claims he is aware of around 30 women who fell victim to the conman, many of whom sent him money."
"The veteran said the news, which came shortly after he returned from deployment and following a battle with alcoholism and the death of a close friend, hit him hard."
"Meanwhile, the accused conman flashed his newfound wealth around online, posting photos of watches and bundles of cash."
"Lovato, of Denver, who is now studying to become a physician assistant, said: ""For someone to do this after everything I had been through - I was really angry."
I served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan and this dude swooped in and took my name and face.
He used all I have done in my life honorably for dishonorable means”.
And thinking of what he did to those women is heartbreaking.
To suddenly have a man who looks really good and is young and he tells you that he loves you; it's wrenching”.
"""These women were telling me they loved me."
"These people had formed relationships with me and I wasn't even in the country,” he added."
Lovato joined the army in 2006 at 27 and was deployed to Iraq where he served with the military police in Baghdad during the Siege of Sadr City.
"When he returned to the US he worked at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, D.C., before being deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 to 2013."
"Lovato, who is dad to Sondra, 19, Trinity, 17, and Novia, 16, said: ""I came home from Afghanistan and all these foreign women started contacting me through Facebook."
"” One said, “Albert, I know you are in a relationship but I fell in love with somebody who said they were you."
We were together ten months in a long distance relationship”.
"""Another woman sent a picture of my face and this girl and it says, “I love you a lot”."
"She said, “I fell in love with you, I'm crying every day”."
"He was targeting vulnerable women - single moms, older women and those who didn't have any self-esteem”."
"""These women were in love with me when they were contacting me and were hoping I could give them some sort of closure, and it breaks my heart to think of that""."
"It's unclear exactly how many victims there are, but said he has been contacted by around 30 women, many of whom sent the conman money - $300 or $400 a time."
"In a message to him, one Indian woman who was affected said: ""I'm broken I'm lost because I fall in love with you by mistake (sic)""."
"This time please stay truthful with this person""."
"Last July, Lovato was approached by Vivian Rita, 47, who had been contacted by the fraudster posing as Lovato in December 2016."
"The office assistant, who does not wish to disclose her last name, was initially taken in by his affection but alarm bells rang when the man promised to fly and see her and sent her a poorly photoshopped plane ticket."
She admits she sent $300 to the scammer after he pleaded with her to help pay for his electricity and was subsequently told by Western Union that it was a scam.
"Rita, who has been single six years, confronted the fraudster who revealed himself as a man from Nigeria who had uploaded various photos of watches and bling online."
She went on to track Lovato down after noticing his last name on one of the pictures the scammer had sent her and trawling through Facebook.
"Rita, of Toronto, Canada, said: ""He messaged me and said he wanted to get to know me."
He wooed me.
Then he started asking for money.
"He said his internet wasn't working and was saying, “Please please please, I won't ask again”."
"""I was determined to find out who this guy was."
"I told him I knew he wasn't the person in the photos and said, “Tell me the truth”."
"He was saying, “Please, stop”."
He finally confessed that he wasn't Lovato and then sent me a picture of himself.
"He said he wasn't s scammer, that he needed money for school and food."
“I'm doing this for other women.
"Lovato and Rita did not report the scam to the police because, since the person responsible lives in Africa and his victims were scattered across the globe."
They felt it was unlikely they would take action and they also fear that more than one scammer might be responsible.
Instead they began reporting the fake profiles to Facebook who investigated and deleted the accounts.
"Lovato also messaged one of the profiles directly to confront the person behind it, and screenshots show the man's bizarre reply in broken English, telling him: ""Get lost you hungry lion""."
"Con artists have since targeted Lovato’s military colleagues, prompting the dad to speak of his own experience in an effort to raise awareness."
"""I just want to tell people to be careful with their military pictures because, at least in America, military people are viewed as heroic, strong and dependable."
"My Facebook profile was open at the time and now there is no way to get them back,” Lovato said."
"""I want to get the word out to other people to be careful""."
"Design thinking is human-centered approach can help organizations reduce implicit biases that affect the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women."
"In the 1970s, only a very small percentage of musicians in top U.S. professional orchestras were female."
"Today, women hold more than 50 percent of the chairs in America's 250 top orchestras."
"In the 1970s and 1980s, orchestras began putting a screen between auditioning musicians and selection committees, some even going so far as to ask applicants to remove their shoes to eliminate the distinctive sound of a woman's footwear."
"After redesigning the environment to remove any knowledge of or reference to gender during the audition process, orchestras suddenly started to hire more women."
"First, although progress has been made in combating deliberate gender discrimination at work, some women still face implicit biases that can subconsciously affect decision-making."
"Second, simple changes in the way a situation is designed installing a screen, removing shoes are not only possible to implement in the workplace, but can also mitigate implicit bias."
"Using strategic changes to transform how a situation or environment is designed, design thinking can offer organizations a powerful way to recognize and reduce the impact of implicit biases in the workplace."
"It can help business leaders, including CMOs, understand what facets of their culture and decision-making practices may be driving biased outcomes and implement design changes to counteract implicit biases, including those related to gender."
"In redesigning facets of the work environment that may be creating barriers for women, organizations can apply the five stages of design thinking: Explore."
"The organization conducts need finding, or exploratory research, using methods such as interviews, focus groups, observation, and data analytics to unearth new insights about women employees, their experiences, and the possible biases that affect their journeys."
"A team that includes women employees with diverse perspectives works to draw on exploratory research and identify drivers of gender bias, seeking to understand the unique challenges women may face in recruitment, retention, and advancement."
Solutions are prototyped and tested through pilot programs with iterative employee feedback and participation.
The team collects gender-disaggregated data and feedback from employees to assess whether the solutions are mitigating bias and improving women's advancement and experience.
"Though not developed specifically as a method for addressing gender bias, design thinking possesses several characteristics that make it well-suited for untangling a complex problem of this nature."
"Not only is the approach grounded in employee experience, guided by information, iterative, and user-validated, it also creates customized solutions tailorable to an organization's specific resources and needs."
"While the application of design thinking to the problem of implicit gender bias is still a novel concept, companies can use this approach to mitigate obstacles in three critical areas of women's advancement: Hiring."
"Research shows that certain hiring practices, such as unstructured interviews or gendered job descriptions, can lead to unequal employment of women."
Companies can take steps such as: conducting surveys and interactive focus groups with job candidates to see if women experience the process differently than men; analyzing interview and hiring data to determine whether there are meaningful gender differences in candidate evaluation and selection; and creating a persona-driven journey map to understand the interview process.
"If internal research suggests implicit bias is a potential factor in women leaving the organization, interviews or persona-driven exercises with women can help elucidate the underlying drivers of attrition."
User-centered research techniques such as journey mapping or interactive focus groups can also help identify why women may be leaving.
"If organizational leaders see low representation of women among managers or executives, some might attribute this disparity to women's personal choices."
"A design thinking approach customizable to each individual organization, its people, its resources, and its needs can help companies better understand how implicit biases affect women's work experiences and aid in the development of effective ways to counter them."
"With its user-centered focus on redesigning environments, this approach can be a powerful tool for addressing previously hidden obstacles to women's recruitment, retention, and advancement, driving the growth of an inclusive workplace culture that empowers all employees."
"In a world where we are trying to reduce gender bias and place importance on individuality rather than fitting into a box, I find that sometimes we are doing just the opposite."
"When I was a mom-to-be I always found it interesting when people asked, ""What are you having""?"
"I would usually reply, ""A baby""."
"All jokes aside, I knew people were asking so they could identify what colors to adorn the child in – blue for boy and pink for girl."
Notice how much importance you place on your child's sex vs. gender and how that influences the things they wear or even the hobbies they take part in.
What are ways that you have broken the gender bias?
How do you support your child's cross-gender interests?
"It doesn't matter if you jump one barrier, they throw another one out."
It found that almost one in three of them had visited a doctor more than five times before receiving their diagnosis.
"Women, as well as low-income patients, experienced longer delays."
They were more likely than men to see 10 or more months pass between their first visit to a doctor and diagnosis –and to have made more than five visits to a doctor prior to diagnosis.
"One 39-year-old woman quoted in the report recalled: “One of the GPs I saw actually made fun of me, saying ‘what did I think my headaches were, a brain tumour?"
A growing body of research is exploring how “implicit” bias – unconscious biases that are usually not linked to consciously held prejudiced attitudes – contributes to disparities in medical treatment.
"“We want to think that physicians just view us as a patient, and they’ll treat everyone the same, but they don’t,” says Linda Blount, president of the Black Women’s Health Imperative."
One of the most pervasive implicit biases in the medical system regards gender.
A 2015 study revealed a longer lag time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in female patients in six out of 11 types of cancer.
It isn’t that women wait longer to seek medical attention – the delay occurs after they’ve first visited their GP.
A 2013 study concluded that more than twice as many women as men had to make more than three visits to a primary care doctor in the UK before getting referred to a specialist for suspected bladder cancer.
"More than just a frustration for patients, these delays cause unnecessary deaths."
"Each year, an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 people die due to diagnostic errors in the US alone."
"In reporting my book Doing Harm, I heard from dozens of women with a range of conditions who, at some point during their search for a diagnosis, were told that their symptoms were due to anxiety, depression, or that all-purpose catch-all: “stress”."
"She first fell ill at age 16, and for years, she suffered from chronic kidney problems, fevers, fatigue, and terrible menstrual and joint pain."
"She saw a primary care doctor, a urologist, and a pulmonologist."
"“Everybody was telling me there was nothing wrong with me,” she says."
"With tests revealing nothing amiss, Jackie’s primary care doctor decided that she must be depressed and prescribed antidepressants."
"They didn’t help at all, but Jackie was “accepting whatever the doctors said”."
"The tendency to attribute women’s physical complaints to mental illness has its roots in the history of ‘hysteria’ – that mythical female disorder that, over the centuries, was blamed on a ‘wandering womb’ or sensitive nerves and eventually, post-Freud, came to be seen as a psychological problem."
"Back in 1965, British psychiatrist Eliot Slater warned that too often a label of hysteria allowed doctors to believe they’d solved the mystery when, in fact, usually they hadn’t."
"After following up with 85 patients who’d been diagnosed with ‘hysteria’ at the National Hospital in London throughout the 1950s – including by Slater himself – he discovered that, nine years later, more than 60% had been found to have an organic neurological disease, including brain tumours and epilepsy."
A dozen of them had died.
"Women have long been considered the typical patients with psychogenic symptoms, so it’s no wonder that they are especially likely to find their symptoms dismissed as “all in their heads”."
"In a 1986 study, for example, researchers looked at a group of patients with serious organic neurological disorders who’d initially been diagnosed with hysteria."
They identified the characteristics that made a patient vulnerable to such a misdiagnosis.
One was having a prior diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.
Another was being a woman.
"The fact that women have higher rates of mood disorders is, itself, likely one reason that it’s so common for women to get a psychogenic label."
"In the US, women are about twice as likely to have a diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder as men."
Studies suggested that as many as 30-50% of women diagnosed with depression were misdiagnosed
"But while women may truly have a higher risk, the difference in prevalence rates may be at least partly a consequence of overdiagnosis in women and underdiagnosis in men."
Studies in the 1990s suggested that as many as 30-50% of women diagnosed with depression were misdiagnosed.
"Furthermore, depression and anxiety are themselves symptoms of other diseases, which often go unrecognised in women."
"As one article points out, “Ironically, medical misdiagnoses of physical conditions may induce depressive reactions in female patients”."
"Once listed in their chart, a psychological disorder heightens the risk that any other physical symptoms a patient has in the future will be automatically dismissed as psychogenic."
"I heard from one woman, a middle-aged Italian immigrant to the US with a history of depression, whose worsening abdominal pain was dismissed as menstrual pain for three years."
It wasn’t taken seriously even when she brought up the fact that she had a family history of colon cancer.
And it wasn’t taken seriously even when she began having rectal bleeding.
"When she finally pushed for a colonoscopy, it revealed stage-three colon cancer."
A friend – a well-off white woman – urged Jackie to go see her doctor in a wealthy suburb.
"He quickly diagnosed her with endometriosis, and surgery alleviated much of her pelvic pain."
"After moving to a new city for graduate school, it took another few years to find another set of doctors who would take her symptoms seriously."
You’re just hysterical
"One of the more common things, especially in emergency rooms, was ‘You’re just drug seeking."
"As a woman of colour, Jackie was facing more than gender bias."
"Implicit biases on the basis of race, class, weight, sexual orientation, and trans status all affect clinical care as well."
"There is particularly robust evidence showing that US patients of colour, black patients especially, are undertreated for pain."
A 2012 meta-analysis of 20 years of published research found that black patients were 22% less likely than whites to get any pain medication and 29% less likely to be treated with opioids.
White children with appendicitis are almost three times as likely as black children to receive opioids in the emergency room Experts point to a stereotype – widely held by healthcare providers yet utterly false – that black patients are more likely to abuse prescription painkillers.
"But the disparity extends to children, suggesting it’s not just about the assumption of drug seeking."
A 2015 study found that white children with appendicitis were almost three times as likely as black children to receive opioids in the emergency room.
A 2016 study suggested that healthcare providers may underestimate black patients’ pain in part due to a belief that they simply don’t actually feel as much pain.
"When 200 white medical students and residents were quizzed on a series of claims about biological differences between the races, like “blacks’ skin is thicker than whites,” a full half thought one or more of the false statements were true."
"And, when they later read case studies of two patients reporting pain, those who had endorsed more false beliefs thought the black patient felt less pain, and undertreated them accordingly."
"The biggest danger of having your symptoms dismissed is that once doctors believe they are ‘all in your head’, they stop searching for another explanation"
But the biggest danger of having your symptoms dismissed is that once doctors have settled on the conclusion that they are ‘all in your head’ – or made up in order to get painkillers – they stop searching for another explanation.
"Consider the experience of patients with rare diseases, who go more than seven years, on average, before being correctly diagnosed."
"Along the way, they visit four primary care doctors and four specialists and receive two to three misdiagnoses."
"While some delay in diagnosing an uncommon disease may be inevitable, this staggering seven-year gap is not simply because it takes that long for doctors to crack a challenging case."
"According to a Eurordis survey of 12,000 rare disease patients in Europe, those who were initially misdiagnosed experienced longer diagnostic journeys."
"Given women’s vulnerability to a psychogenic misdiagnosis, it is perhaps not surprising that they reported significantly longer delays than men."
"For example, it took an average of 12 months for men to get diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an autoimmune disease of the gastrointestinal tract, compared to 20 months for women."
"Men were diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of genetic disorders that affect the connective tissue, in four years."
"“Being a woman should have no influence on a physician’s clinical ability to diagnose a disease,” the authors of the report wrote."
"“It is, therefore, difficult to accept that overall women experience much greater delays in diagnosis than men."
The more rapid diagnosis of men illustrates that the capacity to do so exists”.
"Midway through graduate school, she finally caught a break."
"She had been sick for months with a fever that the doctors, despite soaking her in antibiotics, could not break."
"“A primary care doctor – a woman of colour – believed me, and she collected all of my medical records and literally took them home with her and started trying to piece them together like it was a puzzle”."
She suspected that Jackie might have lupus.
Jackie thought her battle to be taken seriously was over.
"In fact, as a black woman managing a chronic disease that frequently landed her in the ER with excruciating pain, there would many more encounters with dismissive healthcare providers in her future."
"But at least, after 10 years of searching, she finally had a diagnosis — and, with it, the assurance that it had never been ‘all in her head’."
Something really was wrong with her.
"This story is part of the Health Gap, a special series about how men and women experience the medical system – and their own health – in starkly different ways."
"This is an adapted excerpt from Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick."
Karin Wulf is Professor of History at the College of William & Mary and the director of the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture.
"Along with Emily A. Prifogle (Princeton University), Blain and Wulf are co-founders of Women Also Know History."
"With public figures making regular historical claims and engaging in debates over the meaning of historical sites, more historians are beginning to enter the public fray."
Yet historical expertise is still largely perceived or at least represented as male.
This is clearly connected to longstanding patterns in the media and academy.
"Despite efforts to diversify the field of journalism, for example, women are still underrepresented in mainstream media."
It is not uncommon to tune into a nightly news program and see an all-male panel of experts discussing some important news topic.
"Similarly, a quick browse of national newspapers often reveals a troubling pattern: the writers are overwhelmingly white men."
"As a recent article reveals, women are underrepresented on college campuses even despite the highly visible group of female presidents at some of the nation's leading universities."
"And in history, like other fields such as sociology and political science, women are underrepresented in course syllabi, public reading lists, and conference panels."
"Even though women are increasingly entering the field, comprise nearly half of graduate degrees awarded in history, and have held leadership positions in significant professional organizations, the persistent problem of gender bias in the academy is one that scholars must continually work to dismantle."
"Gender bias runs deep and, not surprisingly, impacts scholarly publishing practices."
"Scientists have long been attuned to this bias and have documented the problem in studies, revealing that women as well as minorities are disadvantaged in hiring and promotion decisions, do not play a large role in peer review, are less likely to be awarded grants and fellowships than their male counterparts, and are less likely to have their published work cited."
"Over the last few decades, scholars have employed a range of strategies to address gender bias and inequity in the academy."
"The Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) at Duke University compiled an annotated bibliography of studies as a resource for documenting the often unconscious and unintentional biases against women."
"Recognizing the problems in publishing that will have an impact on researchers careers, several professionals in the Society of Scholarly Publishing have been holding Mind the Gender Gap sessions at the group's annual meetings."
"Organizers Alice Meadows, Director of Community Engagement & Support for ORCID and Lauren Kane, Director of Publisher Relations at BioOne, joined several scholars in an effort to shed light on the gender disparity."
"They pointed out that despite attracting more women than men, scholarly publishing as an industry still remains dominated by men who hold the industry's most senior positions."
Organizations like the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation have supported efforts to close the gender gap in publishing and in other sectors of the academy and beyond.
"Their efforts have been supported by public initiatives such as the OpEd Project, which works closely with colleges and universities to scout and train under-represented experts to take thought leadership positions in their fields."
"In the field of history, several organizations have played critical roles in addressing gender bias, including the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, the Association of Black Women Historians, the Coordinating Council for Women in History, and the American Historical Association's Committee on Women Historians."
The latter was first established in 1969 to advocate for and monitor women's and gender equity in the discipline.
"Over the years, the AHA's Committee on Women Historians have worked to promote women's and gender history and have offered various recommendations for how history departments can better diversity along the lines of gender."
"In 2015, for example, Adeline Koh, Associate Professor of Postcolonial Literature at Stockton University and Sara B. Pritchard, Associate Professor of Science and Technology Studies at Cornell University, launched the ""ilooklikeaprofessor"" hashtag on Twitter to shed light on the homogeneous and inaccurate representations of professors in mainstream media."
"As Koh and Richard acknowledged, the typical representation of professor is almost always (white) male a point underscored by a Google search of the word, professor."
"Another hashtag, ""followwomenwednesday"", aims to remediate gender disparities in social media practices."
"Confirming the work of Bonnie Stewart on social media gendered networks, the hashtag's founderMegan Kate Nelson noted that despite a self-conscious inclination to support women scholars, even her own social media activity was sharply skewed to promoting male writers."
"Using Twee-Q, a now defunct analytical tool, she documented that 72% of her retweets were for male-authored work."
"As historians, we are working with colleagues to shed more light on this issue in our field through a new initiative called Women Also Know History, a media and curriculum tool for promoting women historians."
"Drawing inspiration from Women Also Know Stuff, an initiative launched by a group of women political scientists, we have collaborated with a diverse group of women historians across the country to make this new media and curriculum tool available for academics and members of the general public."
"Since their debut in early 2016, the reception within political science has been positive, with featured articles on the websites of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and the Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) and various recognitions, including an award for service to the community from the APSA's Women's Caucus for Political Science."
"To date, their website includes over 1200 women scholars, with scholar-provided bios, affiliations, and areas of expertise, and has been used as a resource for journalists from national and international press outlets."
"According to editorial board member Christina Wolbrecht, WomenAlsoKnowStuff supports efforts to combat implicit bias in every discipline and every country."
"While our limited resources the volunteer labor of a small group of women in political science limit our scope to women in our own discipline, she explained, we enthusiastically encourage efforts to build similar initiatives for other groups of underrepresented scholars and within other disciplines""."
"Building on this model, Women Also Know History aims to promote the work of women historians."
"Through social media and a searchable website, we are helping to connect academics and journalists with women historians."
"Listing women by subject areas and publications, the site also includes resources for women seeking to become more active in public historical dialogue."
"These efforts will go a long way in amplifying the work of women historians of diverse backgrounds, at various stages of their careers, and in various subfields."
This includes women historians who hold positions in and outside of academia.
"To be sure, this new initiative will not eliminate the problem of history's gender bias."
"Dismantling gender bias requires a wide array of responses and strategies, including changes in hiring and promotion on college campuses."
"However, by providing a tool that helps to bring more visibility to the work of women historians, Women Also Know History is one important step forward in the nationwide effort to close the persistent gender gap in the academy and change the public face of historical expertise."
A girl gets her face painted with an awareness message on female foeticide.
"Apart from the rising number of female foeticide cases in India, more than 200,000 girls under the age of five die each year in the country, finds a Lancet study led by an Indian-origin researcher."
"The study, published in the journal Lancet Global Health, has found that there is on an average 239,000 excess deaths each year of girls under the age of five owing to neglect due to gender discrimination."
"The numbers which are particularly higher in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, are mostly due to unwanted child bearing and subsequent neglect."
"For too long, the focus has been only on prenatal sex selection, said co-researcher Christophe Guilmoto from the Universite Paris Descartes in France."
"""Gender-based discrimination towards girls doesn't simply prevent them from being born, it may also precipitate the death of those who are born,"" he said."
"4 million in a decade can only be checked with stress on female literacy and employment in modern industries, the researchers noted."
"""Regional estimates of excess deaths of girls shows any intervention in the food and health care allocation should particularly target Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where poverty, low social development, and patriarchal institutions persist and investments on girls are limited,"" said Nandita Saikia postdoctoral research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria."
Excess female child mortality is also found in 90 per cent of the districts in the country.
"In all, 29 out of 35 states in India had overall excess mortality in girls under five, and all states and territories bar two had at least one district with excess mortality."
In Uttar Pradesh excess female mortality was calculated at 30.
"In parts of western Rajasthan and northern Bihar, excess mortality as a result of gender bias accounts for 30-50 per cent of the mortality rate of females under five."
"Saikia noted that if there were no excess female deaths in India, the country could have achieved its Millennium Development Goal target on child mortality, of 42 deaths per 1,000 births, very easily."
"The study ""reinforces the need to address directly the issue of gender discrimination in addition to encouraging social and economic development for its benefits on Indian women,"" she said."
Pakistan passed a historic law to recognise trangender rights: How much time does India need?
"A police officer who sued the borough and its police department for allegedly creating a hostile work environment because of her gender will receive a $325,000 settlement."
"The payout stems from a wide-ranging suit filed in 2016 by Officer Diane Warnet, who claimed she was routinely disciplined more harshly than her male colleagues, and passed over for promotions and assignments because she is a woman."
Neither Warnet nor her attorneys could be reached Wednesday.
Warnet's suit outlined a series of alleged incidents that strectched back to when she was hired in 2004.
"For most of her career she served as Ramsey's only woman on the force and she was allegedly held to a different standard than her colleagues, which is a claim that other officers corroborated, according to the lawsuit."
"Warnet claimed she was denied promotion in favor of less senior officers, and she was regularly criticized by the department's top brass for minor infractions such as failing to adjust the camera on her police cruiser."
"Officers also often made inappropriate jokes and sexual comments in front of her, the suit stated."
"During her pregnancy in 2015, Warnet alleged the department was insensitive to her needs while she served as a DARE officer."
"The department's maternity leave policy states that a pregnant officer should not lift anything over 5 pounds, but she was left to carry ""hundreds of pounds"" of audiovisual gear for DARE events, according to the suit."
"As a result, the suit says, Warnet's husband would attend DARE events to ensure she did not have to lift anything heavy."
"Warnet also claimed her efforts for the department either ""went unrecognized or were only begrudgingly recognized""."
"For example, the department gave her husband, who is not a Ramsey police officer, an award thanking him for making the DARE season possible, according to the suit."
"The parent company of Fox News has paid approximately $10 million in settlements with 18 former employees, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal."
The cases arose from intense scrutiny of Fox's workplace culture after it was convulsed by a sexual harassment scandal.
"The cases primarily involved allegations of racial discrimination against the network, along with several gender bias and retaliation claims."
"The larger sexual harassment scandal felled the network's first chairman, the late Roger Ailes, as well as some of its stars, including former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly."
"Confirming the work of Bonnie Stewart on social media gendered networks, the hashtag's founder Megan Kate Nelson noted that despite a self-conscious inclination to support women scholars, even her own social media activity was sharply skewed to promoting male writers."
Filings in other lawsuits supported by additional reporting revealed an organization structured to facilitate sexual harassment of young women by Ailes and a culture that tolerated it in others.
"The perception of that distorted workplace, which corporate executives have labored to dispel, has impeded some of 21st Century Fox's larger ambitions, including the takeover of a major British satellite TV and broadband company called Sky."
"A raft of executives deemed as complicit or compromised were ushered out; other prominent Fox figures, including former host Eric Bolling, former chief Washington correspondent James Rosen and former executive Francisco Cortes, left after questions were raised about their own behavior toward female colleagues."
"These cases focused primarily not on sexual harassment but race, predominantly backroom employees rather than on-air figures."
Brandi also has been a frequent target of criticism by female Fox News employees who complained of harassment; federal prosecutors were scrutinizing past confidential payments by Fox News to women making complaints.
"The Fox anchor and reporter Kelly Wright, who is an African-American journalist and pastor, had filed a lawsuit alleging that he faced racial bias in failing to receive desired opportunities and promotions."
"Wright also charged that he had been asked to play demeaning, racially stereotypical roles."
"""We thank Kelly for his contributions over the years and wish him well as he moves on to the next phase of his career,"" a Fox statement on Wright read."
"In another instance, a reporter based abroad for Fox News filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the network after he was fired over his alleged involvement in a physical altercation."
"He is the brother of a woman who alleged that O'Reilly sexually harassed her, and he said he was fired almost immediately after she appeared on NBC to talk about her experiences."
"That show was hosted by former Fox star Megyn Kelly, who had earlier made her own allegations against Ailes that helped force him out."
"Fox publicly cited its findings about the altercation in making its decision to fire the reporter, which took place a few weeks later."
"He also provided testimony to regulators in Britain against the bid for Sky by the parent company and its controlling owners, the Murdoch family."
"The company points to reforms at the network, including sweeping changes in human resources policies; the appointment of a new top executive vice president who reports to the top attorney for 21st Century Fox instead of directly to Fox News executives; the creation of a workplace diversity and inclusion council; mandatory network-wide training in workplace climate; and the appointment of more women to top executive and on-air positions."
"On Monday, Wigdor LLP filed papers to be allowed to withdraw from cases involving two other clients with ties to Fox."
"In one case, a Fox News commentator named Rod Wheeler alleged he had been defamed by having words put in his mouth in Fox News coverage claiming to have found a link between a dead former Democratic party staffer and the leaks of thousands of emails from party officials in 2016."
"Under duress, Fox withdrew the story but has not apologized for it."
"According to transcripts obtained by NPR, the presiding judge in the case grilled an attorney from Wigdor last month about whether the language in the story was stark enough to ensure that Wheeler had been misrepresented or defamed."
The judge expressed deep skepticism about Wheeler's case.
"The Fox commentator and former homicide detective had sued Fox, its reporter, Malia Zimmerman, and Ed Butowsky, a former unpaid Fox commentator who, according to the lawsuit, was instrumental to the creation of the story."
"The defendants have filed motions for dismissal, but neither motion has been ruled upon yet."
"Widgor's firm also represented the conservative commentator Scottie Nell Hughes, who said in her lawsuit that she was raped by Fox Business Network anchor Charles Payne and that the network failed to hire her in retaliation for her allegations."
"Fox cleared Payne, saying it had conducted a review that found the two had had a consensual relationship."
"In both cases, the Wigdor law firm said that there had been a fundamental breakdown in relations with its clients but did not withdraw any of the accusations or the material supporting them."
"Taken together, the week's activities suggest the winding down of outstanding legal challenges to the network as the Murdochs seek to shed much of the rest of their entertainment holdings: They plan to sell much of 21st Century Fox (though not Fox News) to the Walt Disney Co. Comcast is making a run for Sky and may bid for Fox's entertainment holdings too."
"Hollywood’s MeToo movement has created global awareness around predatory behavior toward women in the film industry and exposed a number of high-profile offenders, sparking a wider conversation around stark inequities in workplaces around the nation."
"While the obstacles and biases women face in academia and professionally are far from news, the momentum of this equality moment has created a shift in the discourse around inclusion in every industry."
"“This has been going on as long as women have been in the workplace, but … we’ve got the world’s attention now,”"
“Let’s use … it is an opening that allows us to take the “me too” … moment … and turn it into a movement that produces sustainable change”.
"In an effort to collapse the old systems holding back women in the tech industry, Correll is championing The Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab, a Stanford-funded VMware Inc. initiative created to research and take action against the longstanding barriers to women’s advancement."
"Betsy Sutter, senior vice president and chief people officer of VMware, and Alaina Percival, chief executive officer of Women Who Code, also sat down with Martin during the Women Transforming Technology event to discuss the initiative and the state of women in the industry at large."
"This week, theCUBE spotlights Shelley Correll, Betsy Sutter and Alaina Percival in our Women in Tech feature."
"Watch the complete video interview with Shelley Correll below: ‘In order to innovate, you have to be inclusive’ The number of women currently working computing jobs is 25 percent, and only 11 percent hold executive roles in the tech industry, according to the National Center for Women & Technology."
"On average, women under age 25 earn 29 percent less than their male peers."
"“Research shows that the progress, in terms of moving women into leadership, has all but stalled."
"If we just sit back and wait, we’re not going to see … gender equality in our lives, our daughter’s lives,” Correll said."
"Tech poses unjust challenges to women through biases in education, recruiting and career advancement."
"In one practice termed the “motherhood penalty,” women are deemed less suitable for roles if they are perceived as being mothers during the hiring process."
"“Our research found that if you take a resume for a woman and … add in subtle information that she’s a mother … that people are 100 percent less likely to recommend her for hire,” Correll said."
"This prejudice is likely based on a belief that a woman’s familial commitment will preclude her from professional obligations, a judgement not leveraged against fathers in the industry."
“People see fathers as more committed to the job than childless men.
Parenthood works differently for men and women in the workplace.
"One of the barriers we want to get past is the effects of biases on how people are evaluated,” Correll said."
Women continue to suffer the effects of biases long after initial recruiting evaluation.
"Data shows that women are leaving technical roles at a rate of 50 percent at the mid-career level, according to Percival."
"Despite the commonly held belief that they are leaving to raise families, new reports reveal a more disconcerting truth behind the turnover."
“A big reason women leave tech … is they don’t feel like they’re supported in the workplace.
"If you’re in a workplace where you constantly feel your talent is not being appreciated, that’s one way you quickly don’t feel included as a technical worker,” Correll said."
"While the harmful effects of a lack of inclusivity at an individual level are enough to inspire change, the negative impact of inequality doesn’t end at the employee."
"Hiring and management biases point to inefficient talent assessments, which means the best employees may not be receiving appropriate opportunities to benefit from the success of their company."
"Companies with diversity at the executive level are 21 percent more profitable, according to research from McKinsey & Co. “In order to innovate, you have to be inclusive."
"Companies are starting to understand that if you don’t have diversity, you’re not going to have innovation, and you’re not going to win,” Sutter said."
"Watch the complete video interview with Betsy Sutter below: A new chapter in women’s leadership In search of a lasting solution to all the issues created by a lack of inclusion, a number of organizations have risen to the occasion through initiatives that provide education, career training and support, and direct efforts toward removing biased barriers to entry for good."
"Women Who Code, the largest and most active community of technical women in the world, offers a positive career impact for 80 percent of its members through a powerful professional network of women working in science, technology, engineering and math jobs."
Percival credits VMware’s partnership in Women Who Code with the organization’s efficacy.
"“When someone … gives you what you need to be able to harness that potential, you are able to achieve great things."
"In its latest inclusion venture, VMware partnered with Stanford to invest $15 million in the Stanford VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab, a new lab focused on researching and developing solutions for advancing women’s leadership."
"Through its learnings, the lab aims to diagnose all barriers to women’s advancement and pilot solutions within companies to develop interventions that can be implemented across the industry."
“This is a new chapter … around women’s leadership … and innovation.
"As more organizations recognize the need for change, women are being increasingly validated in their calls for action in the industry."
Women are coming together
"If you get to 10 employees with no women, you’re already behind the curve,” she said."
"Attention to biases against women is a positive step for tech, but it’s only the first step to creating a more inclusive industry for all marginalized groups."
"They’re biases about gender, but also about parenthood, race, ethnicity, sexuality."
What do boys in America think about being boys today?
"Whom do they look up to, and how are they navigating the transition from being boys to becoming men?"
The past 50 years have redefined what it means to be female in America.
"Girls today are told that they can do anything, be anyone."
They’re outperforming boys in school at every level.
"To be a girl today is to be the beneficiary of decades of conversation about the complexities of womanhood, its many forms and expressions."
"Boys, though, have been left behind."
No commensurate movement has emerged to help them navigate toward a full expression of their gender.
It’s no longer enough to “be a man” — we no longer even know what that means.
"In this unit, we explore some of the questions Mr. Black, and others, raise, and suggest ways to deconstruct definitions of masculinity as they manifest in our society and our lives."
We end with suggestions for several projects students might take on to expand and reimagine what “being a man” might mean in their own lives and in our society at large.
"This is a sensitive topic, and some of the readings, discussion questions or activities may not be suitable for your students."
"If you are doing a larger study of gender issues, please see the links at the bottom of this post for related lesson plans, including one on the MeToo movement, and one, contributed by a teacher, on pronoun use in schools."
We are at a historic moment in gender relations.
"The women’s movement can move ahead with the active support, involvement and encouragement of men, or fall behind as men—especially young men—take up arms behind the quiet, but active, angry men’s movement."
"Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are tapping into what I’m calling a “Lean Out” generation of young, discouraged and angry men—men who are feeling abandoned by the thousands of years of history that defined what it meant to be a real man: to be strong; to be a provider; to be in authority; to be the ultimate decision maker; and to be economically, educationally, physically and politically dominant."
"A growing percentage of young men are being out-earned by young women, as women capture 60% of the higher education degrees required for success in today’s economy."
We have the window right now to redefine what a good man—a “real man”—is in the 21st century.
"As a society, we need to elevate the standards to which men are being held and no longer accept the outdated mantra that “men will be men, and boys will be boys”."
We must have zero tolerance for the destructive brotherhood that occurs when men of all ages gather and depend on sexism and misogyny as their common bond.
These are the tools of the patriarchy; they are the rituals of hazing that signify a boy’s entry into manhood.
They can be discarded if we create a new narrative that welcomes young men into a truly gender-equal society.
"We should beware of falling into the trap of believing that the future of men is an “either, or” confrontation with the women’s movement."
The future of men is women.
I believe women and the women’s movement can be at the center of a new narrative and national conversation focused on developing positive male role models for future generations.
"Focusing on better men, dads, husbands, boyfriends and sons does not come at the expense of the rightful attention to women’s rights and equality."
"The challenge is that there is no foundation on which to build a movement of support, guidance and respect for men who are confronting outdated notions of masculinity."
"A hopeful and positive future for men and women living in a gender-equal world requires that we also acknowledge the crisis that many young men are facing, and that we invest in solutions."
"As a society we need to be more supportive of paternity leave, stay-at-home dads, and men entering traditionally “feminine” careers, such as nursing or teaching."
"We need media messages, commercials and TV shows that portray men as responsible, competent and caring husbands, sons and fathers, instead of idiots and/or misogynists."
"Just as we encourage girls to be strong and confident, to enter STEM careers, and to be anything they want to be, we need to similarly encourage our sons to embrace female-dominated HEAL careers (health, education, administrative, literacy)"
"We need feminist leaders to call attention to destructive media messages that negatively portray men, just as they call attention to messages that are destructive to women’s self-image and self-esteem."
We must invest in an educational redesign that better serves both boys and girls.
"Overwhelmingly, researchers point to classroom environments and curriculums that are designed for girls to succeed and boys to fail."
"We need to enhance relationships and family life by inviting young men into women’s support programs to equally educate and support both men and women, fostering open and honest conversations."
"If we fail to focus on redefining men’s roles alongside women’s, we are in danger of fostering a culture of hostility among men who are feeling left out in school, in the job market, and in relationships."
"These men will be less likely to accept gender equality, less likely to advocate advances for women, and less likely to foster healthy relationships and families."
"For the sake of a healthy society, we need to redefine a positive and appropriate form of masculinity."
"Just as it’s no longer acceptable to educationally, economically and politically restrict women, it is no longer acceptable to disregard men’s issues."
"When we bring men into the conversation, we further gender equality for everyone."
I would bet a large sum that my father has seen 90 percent of the films nominated for this year’s Academy Awards.
"And my guess, too, is that he cried during every single one of them."
"He’s not embarrassed to cry at movies, or television shows, or commercials."
"He’s a sap, pretty proudly."
"Or, he’s at least an unconcerned one."
"Physically, my dad is strong; he plays lots of tennis."
But he’s very skinny.
"He refers to his legs as sticks, and says they are not of the human varietal—that they more resemble poultry (he’s right, by the way)."
"My dad is overwhelmingly kindhearted, he’s there for me, is super-keen on listening to my problems, and he’s affectionate."
Poppi texts me at least three times a day to tell me he loves me and is proud of me.
"In fact, just now, as I was in the middle of writing this paragraph, he sent me a text that read, “I love you infinity times infinity and best in all of the galaxies and beyond through eternity”."
"And every time I publish a piece of writing, he sends out an e-mail announcing my new article to his friends, our family, his colleagues, my friends, and also, somehow, my colleagues."
"This side of Poppi doesn’t quite fit our country’s definition of “masculine”—which we often assume includes attributes like strong, withdrawn, and violent."
"But in other ways, my “sissy” dad is quite “masculine”."
"He’s got a bad temper, though it’s cooled with age."
"I remember visiting his office when I was a kid and seeing holes in the wall—when I asked, he’d say, sheepishly, that they were the result of his being frustrated after a phone call or meeting with a client, judge, or opposing counsel."
"Also, Poppi doesn’t like it when you disagree with him—fair enough, that’s natural; I don’t either."
"But he’ll interrupt you over and over and over to get his point across, drowning out any possibility of your actually finishing your thought."
"On days and nights when he watched football when I was growing up, I’d hear him clear across the apartment screaming into the television, “Oh, come on, you [expletive expletive expletive]” in a tone that frightened me."
"Nowadays, I stay away from his room when he’s watching his football—and I’m pretty sure that’s why my mom got her own TV in the kitchen."
Award-winning actress Shwetha Menon recently got selected to the executive committee of the Association of the Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA).
"Ever since this news came out she has been bombarded with bizarre reactions from her fans, including threatening phone calls and a fake message circulated in the name of noted film producer Antony Perumbavoor."
"However, Swetha is not someone who would fret over controversies and gossips, and doesn't hesitate to express her opinions openly."
Patriarchy in cinema Shwetha claimed she has never felt that the Malayalam cinema industry exclusively favours any gender.
"I don't particularly analyze whether the important positions in it are given to men or women, she remarked."
No favours I truly believe that our women in this industry are really strong.
They know how to speak for themselves though the mode of expression may differ.
"I am happy that I got elected, the actress pointed out."
Shwetha also stated she is aware about the various problems faced by female artists on movie sets.
She added that she has always raised her voice for her rights.
You don't have to be an executive member to demand your rights.
"When I speak up, it would be beneficial for other women as well."
I would definitely bring to the association's notice the various difficulties faced by female artists.
I am not a fool to think that all the problems of women were discussed because of me.
"All the women in the executive would open up about these issues, she hoped."
"Confirming that she was not a part of the Women in Cinema Collective, the organisation formed by some of the female artists and technicians in Malayalam cinema, Shwetha said that she doesn't know anything about it."
I have experienced many problems personally and have tried to solve it in my own way.
"Without blood or a broken bone for proof, treatment often depends on how much a physician trusts a patient."
"Throughout history, physicians tend to mistrust women more than men when it comes to the question: how much does it hurt?"
"That means that women are misdiagnosed, mistreated, or dismissed altogether."
Today we’re talking about gender bias in medical care.
"There’s a troubling pattern in children’s books: When the characters are not human, as is often the case, females are often strangely absent."
I am not splitting politically correct hairs.
"The main character is a baby chicken who wants to avoid a life of “laying eggs all day” and sets off to find adventure with “Wonder Pug,” a male."
"The feline antagonist is male, too."
The would-be egg-laying chick is also male.
"And, no, this is not a story about gender confusion."
"This oversight on the part of the author, editors and publishers would be laughable if it weren’t so disturbing."
"Authors lend everything from beavers to bulldozers big personalities and adventures, but rarely give them a female pronoun."
"After I discovered the discrepancy in “Chick ’n’ Pug,” I tore through every book on my daughter’s shelf."
"I examined the first 50 published in the past 10 years, and tallied every nonhuman character: 45 female and 104 male."
"One 2011 study confirms that I’m not imagining things: In 5,618 titles evaluated, nearly twice as many males are depicted as females."
"I’m no scientist, but I believe females account for about 50 percent of the planet’s population."
So where are we in books that make up our children’s earliest literary diet?
"If girls have challenges with self-worth, it can’t help that the stories they hear from infancy ignore their very existence."
Females do abound in the form of mothers.
"The scared duck’s sex is ambiguous, but five other creatures are identified as male."
"The lone female is, as usual, a mother on the sidelines."
"And if the characters are engaged in social drama, they’re a mix of girls and boys, whether humans or llamas."
"But if the story involves industrious skunks or adventurous appliances, females are often missing."
"Sadly, the conditioning is so strong that the authors guilty of this imbalance are often women."
"It was one of my favorites until I realized: The human zookeeper’s friends — a tortoise, a penguin, an elephant, an owl and a rhinoceros — are all male."
My blood pressure rose as I read one single page with a series of “him’s” and “his’s”.
"If creators as thoughtful as the Steads could write a book lacking a single female character, we clearly have a problem."
Authors need not manufacture a flood of “girl power” books and stories subverting the old princess theme.
"The solution can be more natural, and therefore more powerful: Just take a whole bunch of “he’s” and turn them to “she’s”."
Many parents are already working to do just that in their daily lives.
"When my husband or I see a caterpillar outside, we’re as likely to say, Look at how fuzzy she is!"
But some authors have overcome the male assumption.
"“A House in the Woods” by Inga Moore, for example, left me stunned with gratitude as I read it to my daughter."
Two of the four main critters are female.
"To parents and educators, remind your favorite authors that half of all squirrels and rhinos have two X chromosomes."
She wrote this article for the Washington Post.
"For his birthday this year, my 5-year-old son asked for a My Little Pony sweatshirt."
"He didn't know that it was categorized as girls' clothing, only that, like his beloved Rainbow Dash, it was polychromatic, glittery, winged and perfect."
"He has spent his early years in Oakland, California, largely surrounded by adults who avoid use of the nouns ""boys"" and ""girls"" unless necessary."
"His world is blissfully, ignorantly gender-neutral."
"In the fall, he'll be heading to elementary school, and I was thinking it might be time to explain to him that as natural as his love for this sweatshirt is, there are a lot of people who find a boy in a girl's sweatshirt unnatural and won't hesitate to let him know."
"He, a scrupulous monitor of fairness in matters large and small, will ask whether there are also things people think girls shouldn't wear."
"I remorsefully, will have to tell him ""no""."
"Gender progress: a one-way street Though feminism has made great progress in stripping childhood of gender norms, the efforts have been awfully lopsided."
"Meanwhile, there's still not a single traditionally feminine thing a boy can do that wouldn't raise eyebrows."
"A boy who likes wearing jewelry or makeup, twirling in a tutu or caring for baby dolls is at best the subject of conversations conducted sotto voce."
The tomboy phenomenon is more than 400 years old and has gone from outsider to aspirational to anachronistic over the course of the 20th century; the tomgirl remains a nonstarter.
"Describe a boy with a phrase that includes the word ""girl"" in it, and you're likely to make his parents' spines quiver, including those of many of the feminist dads I know."
"Parents are increasingly giving their daughters boy names like James and Finn; few among us would dare give our sons a girl name, because pity the boy named Jenn or Sofia."
Girls fought and won the right to join the Boy Scouts; I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for boys to gain entry to the Girl Scouts.
All this might make you conclude that girls have it better.
"And in some ways, they do."
Women have changed what it means to be a woman and embrace a much larger human canvas.
"Men are still painting on half the canvas,"" said Michael Kimmel, a professor of sociology and gender studies and author of "" Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men ""."
"""Now, it's perfectly permissible for girls to (enter) boyland, but heaven help the boy who wants to move to the other side""."
But a closer look at this gender revolution among children reveals to what degree this whole enterprise has been tipped in favor of the masculine.
"Barbie has been a member of the armed forces, a presidential candidate and an engineer; boys' dolls continue be, nearly exclusively, action figures conscripted to battle."
"Disney movies have featured a number of macho or strong and brave female characters, including ""Pocahontas"" (1995), ""Mulan"" (1998) and ""Moana"" (2016); meanwhile, the male characters continue to alternate between brute and naïf."
"Girls get to flip through books like "" Strong is the New Pretty ,"" but no publication is telling boys that typically feminine traits like caring for others or, yes, taking an interest in beauty (which is often tsked tsked in boys) is the new strong."
"Girls have been told that they can do anything, be anything, and they largely can, without judgment."
However -- and here's the catch -- that's true only if they are physically strong and career-oriented and eschew most of the traditional trappings of femininity.
"In short, they will gain respect if they act like boys."
Girls who act like boys are moving up the social ladder.
"Boys who are acting like anything but masculine are moving down and risk losing their status,"" Kimmel said."
Expanding the definition of 'boyhood' That there is no cultural infrastructure to support slightly feminine boys like mine only underscores this point.
"Where are the books, movies, toys and video games working to gently expand the notion of boyhood, quietly and uncontroversially permitting them to take pride in their love of pink glittery hearts, baby dolls or whatever else their budding hearts desire?"
A bedazzled ninja turtle or a feature film about a peasant boy who falls hopelessly in love with princess would help all children feel more emboldened by their girlier proclivities.
"Richard Gottlieb, founder and CEO of Global Toy Experts and publisher of Global Toy News, said the toy industry has experienced far more pressure to expand the definition of girls' toys than it has to expand the definition of boys' toys."
"Almost all the social demand has been on the girls' side,"" Gottlieb said."
But he's not without hope.
"In 2017, the toy industry did away with the categories of ""boy toy"" and ""girl toy"" in its Toy of the Year Awards, and there's been a small uptick in dolls marketed to boys."
"""I think you are going to see more ('girl' toys marketed to boys or as gender-neutral), but it is going to come later,"" Gottlieb said."
"Remember, you still have 20th-century leadership marketing to 21st-century young adults."
"As these young adults move their way up through the ladder, you are going to see more and more gender neutrality."
"My search for boys toys and media geared at ""feminine"" boys has yielded very little."
"I found a handful books written for gender-nonconforming boys that do some of this work, but they aren't the right fit."
My son freely and easily identifies as a boy.
"He doesn't need our help in his rejection of the label of ""boy""; he needs the meaning of that label to expand."
"Permitting, let alone encouraging, boys to be more girly is scary."
We want our boys to keep being like boys because masculinity is still where the power lies.
And we want our girls to be more like boys for the same reason.
"But while that method of seeking gender equality has worked, there are limits to how far it can get us."
"In her recent book "" Women and Power: A Manifesto ,"" Mary Beard encourages readers to scrutinize our notions of power, particularly those inhospitable to behaviors and experiences traditionally associated with women."
"""If women are not perceived to be fully within the structures of power, surely it is power that we need to redefine rather than women""?"
Widening the perimeters of boyhood would be a great place to begin this work of redefining power.
"It should, as others have suggested , help inoculate boys against the stoicism and aggression some of them experience in their teenage years."
"Raewyn Connell, author of "" Masculinities ,"" said many teenage boys still feel as though they must avoid any signs of weakness or femininity."
"This, in turn, feeds homophobia, because gay men are associated with the parts of themselves that they feel they must suppress."
"With teenage boys, the search for respect and recognition often results in exaggerated displays of dominating masculinity: the football hero, the first guy in the peer group who smokes, the playground bully, etc."
"This is often accompanied by ""a stark rejection of 'girl things."
"Broadening boyhood will also help give legitimacy to women's work and interests, bringing things like beautification, compromise and caring for others into the official range of human endeavors that truly matter."
"Recently, I came across a Twitter thread explaining the backstory to the Etsy-favorite quote ""Well-behaved women seldom make history""."
"We've long interpreted it as a call to arms for women to put down their babies, oven mitts or lipstick and start making some noise -- like a man."
"Historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich included the sentence in a paper about women in colonial America, whose domestic existences had largely rendered them uninteresting to historians and therefore absent from history books."
"Ulrich wasn't telling women to act more like men; she was telling us to pay more attention, and imbue more importance, to a traditionally feminine existence."
Because nobody thinks that what they are doing is worthwhile.
"I bought my son the Rainbow Dash sweatshirt, and he wears it on a regular basis, on top of his equally adored superhero t-shirts and paired with his knee-worn pants."
"We never had a talk, but his breezy confidence in wearing this flamboyant hoodie suggests that he doesn't need one, at least not yet."
"For him, there is no inconsistency between boy and glittery rainbow, and this palpable certainty serves as an invitation for others to feel the same."
He also doesn't need my protection.
"He needs my support, a beaming mom waving from the sidelines as he seeks to make his version of well-behaved history, by way of glittery wings or whatever else he chooses to keep him afloat."
"Hillary Clinton isn’t the only woman struggling to find an ideal mix of feminism and femininity, one that allows a woman to behave both like and unlike a man without being penalized either way."
"Mothers of daughters, even if they don’t support the former first lady, feel, if not her pain, at least her conflict."
"You need only look at the staggering success, in a publishing industry gone soft, of two advice manuals for young women, “The Daring Book for Girls” and “The Girls’ Book: How to Be the Best at Everything”."
"Those volumes were inspired by “The Dangerous Book for Boys,” a gilt-embossed paean to old-school adventure that has nearly two million copies in print and caused a furor among the mothers of daughters who resented the implicit “Girls Keep Out” sign nailed to its cover."
Aren’t today’s young women as eager — and as able — as boys to build a treehouse or shoot marbles?
They missed the point.
"The tantalizing chapters on building a go-cart and making secret ink from (presumably your own) pee were designed not so much for boys themselves but to induce nostalgia among fathers — who are typically the ones purchasing the book — for their own Huckleberry childhoods, those halcyon days before cable, Wii, Facebook and cellphones."
"Each book reflects a different vision of feminism, femininity and girlhood, but at its heart is a desire — or perhaps the fervent hope — for girls to have it both ways: to be able to paint their nails and break them too; to embrace whatever it might be that makes them girls in a way that will sustain rather than constrain them."
"For decades now, girls have been told that “you can do anything”."
"This is the “I am woman, see me shop” strain of feminism, the one that’s given rise to mother-daughter spa packages and endless reruns of “Sex and the City”."
"Perhaps the shift from purchasing power to purchase empowerment was inevitable: once marriage and motherhood ceased to be the bulwarks of female identity, what remained to distinguish us from men beyond our God-given ability to accessorize?"
"The Daring Book for Girls,” commissioned by the publishers of “The Dangerous Book for Boys” as a companion volume, seems to take its cues more from “relational” feminism, which argues that while girls’ psychological development, moral reasoning and “ways of knowing” may overlap with that of boys, they are also distinct and should be valued as such."
"“Daring” makes the case for a separate-but-equal female culture of play that, like its male counterpart, deserves resurrection and preservation."
Any former girl — read: current mom — will find its chapters on jacks and hand-clap games irresistible.
Yet the fact is that today’s girls won’t spend their lives in a separate sphere.
"Girls themselves, I’d wager, will see them as the equivalent of a granola bar in the Halloween bag."
When Nicole Lee Hallberg finally got to the in-person interview for a résumé editing job—after three or four rigorous Skype interviews that included being watched as she did some on-the-spot editing—her future boss made a comment that astounded her.
"“I wasn’t actually considering hiring any females, but you did so well,” he said, that he decided to call her in for the next round."
"He eventually hired her, the first woman to join his four-person company."
It wouldn’t be his last sexist offense.
"“He would say females this and females that,” Hallberg tells Newsweek."
She would soon learn that the boss was only a small part of the frustration.
"As Hallberg recounted in a Medium post and her friend and former colleague Martin R. Schneider explained in a series of tweets on Thursday, the company’s clients also treated Hallberg differently from her male co-workers."
"Schneider’s thread went viral on Thursday, garnering thousands of retweets and inspiring one reader to turn it into a Twitter “Moment”."
"They were all doing intensive revisions of résumés for clients, many of whom worked in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields like computer information technology, but also included every kind of job from baristas to literal rocket scientists, a zookeeper who worked with elephants to someone who developed backend systems for adult novelty products."
The interactions would take place entirely online; the editors never met with their clients face to face.
Schneider and Hallberg worked out of their boss’s apartment in a swanky high-rise in Center City in Philadelphia.
"Hallberg started one year after Marty in the same role with the same amount of experience but at a lower salary, and continued to get smaller raises than her colleague and friend, she says."
"When she was hired, he was bumped up and became her supervisor in name, though in practice they did the same work."
"She got used to staff meetings during which she was constantly interrupted, talked over or ignored, even by Schneider."
"“Marty he’s a cool guy,” she tells Newsweek."
But “he did things that were dumb and sexist all the time”.
"With him though, “we were good enough friends that I could just light into him”."
He took her words to heart and has started paying close attention to sexist behavior around him.
"In addition to dealing with the culture at the “office,” Hallberg says she “struggled all the time,” when working with clients, who would often fight her."
They mansplained things all the time.
"I was doing thousands of these résumés, and people were trying to explain the simplest terms to me”."
"She remembers asking one “kid” she worked with, for example, whether he’d used any kind of source management in his previous work."
"Instead of answering her question, her client insisted on trying to define the term for her, even though it was clear from her inquiry she already knew."
"On other occasions, her clients would be argumentative or doubt whether she knew what she was doing."
"“I must have said out loud once a day, ‘Didn’t these people hire us?"
“So one day I'm emailing a client back-and-forth about his résumé and he is just being IMPOSSIBLE.
"’ It was Nicole he was being rude to, not me”."
She admitted that she’d even used his email signature once or twice before.
"“You’re shitting me,” she remembers him saying."
So they decided to spend a week using each other’s email signatures to see what would happen.
"They “transferred” existing clients to work with a “new editor,” changing signatures on them when in fact they were continuing to email back and forth with the same person, and took up new clients using one another’s names."
"“People were more receptive, taking me more seriously. They assumed knew what I was doing. I didn’t have to prove it to them”."
She saw fewer suggestions and doubts.
"Meanwhile, Schneider wrote in his tweets that “I was in hell."""
Everything I asked or suggested was questioned.
One asked if I was single.
"The story is just one example, anecdotal evidence of sexism rather than scientific."
"I'm the Boss of 300 men and I'm treated like I'm an idiot, every day."
"From STEM guys ignoring/criticizing emails, to bending over to help."
A third shared that “my law partner and I have this experience.
Often he has to give the same advice I just gave for it to ‘take.
"In one study looking at instructors for an online class, “students rated the male identity significantly higher than the female identity, regardless of the instructor’s actual gender, demonstrating gender bias”."
Another study had science faculty rate applications randomly assigned male and female names for a lab manager position and found that “faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant”.
"Yet another found that when applications for tech jobs were stripped of identifying details, the percentage of women selected for interviews rose from five to 54 percent."
Many of the men who responded were shocked to hear this happens.
"The overwhelming majority of responses have been positive and supportive, she says, but still some men have tried to find “non-sexist” reasons for the outcome of the experiment or doubting the veracity of the story."
"“One thing I really would want to emphasize,” she says, is “that a lot of guys just don’t want to believe this is true and will make excuses and find justifications and reasons why this doesn’t exist,” she adds."
"When Timnit Gebru was a student at Stanford University’s prestigious Artificial Intelligence Lab, she ran a project that used Google Street View images of cars to determine the demographic makeup of towns and cities across the U.S. While the AI algorithms did a credible job of predicting income levels and political leanings in a given area, Gebru says her work was susceptible to bias—racial, gender, socio-economic."
She was also horrified by a ProPublica report that found a computer program widely used to predict whether a criminal will re-offend discriminated against people of color.
"Companies, government agencies and hospitals are increasingly turning to machine learning, image recognition and other AI tools to help predict everything from the credit worthiness of a loan applicant to the preferred treatment for a person suffering from cancer."
The tools have big blind spots that particularly effect women and minorities.
"“The worry is if we don't get this right, we could be making wrong decisions that have critical consequences to someone's life, health or financial stability,” says Jeannette Wing, director of Columbia University's Data Sciences Institute."
Now in the wake of several high-profile incidents—including an AI beauty contest that chose predominantly white faces as winners—some of the best minds in the business are working on the bias problem.
"The issue will be a key topic at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, an annual confab that starts today in Long Beach, California, and brings together AI scientists from around the world."
The programmers see what worked and what didn't and fine-tune from there.
"Even when the data accurately mirrors reality the algorithms still get the answer wrong, incorrectly guessing a particular nurse in a photo or text is female, say, because the data shows fewer men are nurses."
"In some cases the algorithms are trained to learn from the people using the software and, over time, pick up the biases of the human users."
AI also has a disconcertingly human habit of amplifying stereotypes.
Phd students at the University of Virginia and University of Washington examined a public dataset of photos and found that the images of people cooking were 33 percent more likely to picture women than men.
"When they ran the images through an AI model, the algorithms said women were 68 percent more likely to appear in the cooking photos."
Scientists at Boston University and Microsoft's New England lab zeroed in on so-called word embeddings—sets of data that serve as a kind of computer dictionary used by all manner of AI programs.
"In this case, the researchers were looking for gender bias that could lead algorithms to do things like conclude people named John would make better computer programmers than ones named Mary."
Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker.
"The researchers explain how they combed through the data, keeping legitimate correlations (man is to king as woman is to queen, for one) and altering ones that were biased (man is to doctor as woman is to nurse)."
"In doing so, they created a gender-bias-free public dataset and are now working on one that removes racial biases."
"“We have to teach our algorithms which are good associations and which are bad the same way we teach our kids,” says Adam Kalai, a Microsoft researcher who co-authored the paper."
"He and researchers including Cynthia Dwork—the academic behind the 2011 push towards AI fairness—have also proposed using different algorithms to classify two groups represented in a set of data, rather than trying to measure everyone with the same yardstick."
"So for example, female engineering applicants can be evaluated by the criteria best suited to predicting a successful female engineer and not be excluded because they don't meet criteria that determine success for the larger group."
These “unknown unknowns”—a condundrum made famous by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld—are the missing areas in a dataset the engineer or researcher doesn't even realize aren't there.
"Researchers are looking for places where the software had high confidence in its decision, finding mistakes and noting the features that characterize the error."
That information is then provided to the system designer with examples they can use to retrain the algorithm.
Researchers say it will probably take years to solve the bias problem.
"While they see promise in various approaches, they consider the challenge not simply technological but legal too because some of the solutions require treating protected classes differently, which isn't legal everywhere."
Not only does that make it difficult figuring out how bias creeps in; the opaqueness also makes it hard for the person denied parole or the teacher labeled a low-performer to appeal because they have no way of knowing why that decision was reached.
"Google researchers are studying how adding some manual restrictions to machine learning systems can make their outputs more understandable without sacrificing output quality, an initiative nicknamed GlassBox."
The good news is that some of the smartest people in the world have turned their brainpower on the problem.
"“The field really has woken up and you are seeing some of the best computer scientists, often in concert with social scientists, writing great papers on it,” says University of Washington computer science professor Dan Weld."
"The message that we consistently send out is that in order to achieve any kind of significant career goals, girls need to adopt traits that are typically associated with masculinity."
"A few months ago, my four year-old son went to a classmate's birthday."
"The party was superhero-themed and the loot bags were packed with cute little superhero trinkets, including temporary tattoos."
The other children and parents in attendance oohed and ahed over her forearm.
Every single one of them showed their admiration and approval for her Iron Man tattoo.
"Later, as we parents were watching our cake-smeared kids run around in a sugar-induced frenzy, one of the other mothers turned to me and said, ""Isn't it funny that your son loves My Little Pony so much?"""
"I mean, he's such a boy."
"I've been thinking a lot about this episode, along with all the other weird remarks people have made about my kid's love for all things Rainbow Dash."
I've especially been thinking about them since reading sailor mercury's wonderful post Coding Like a Girl on Medium.
I've also been contemplating my own internal biases about women and how I view them within existing power structures.
"While I know that I'm not saying anything huge or revolutionary here, I'm still going to go ahead and put it out there: We live in a culture that simultaneously claims to embrace the equality of men and women and at the same time seriously devalues femininity."
"Little girls are, for the most part, taught that women can be anything."
"However, what they aren't taught is that people who dress, think or act in a traditionally feminine manner can be anything."
"Like, sure you can be a girl and write code, but you can't write code while wearing a dress."
"You can chair a meeting, but not while wearing sparkly hair clips."
"You can repair a bicycle, but not while wearing lipstick."
Everyone knows that lipstick prevents people from being competent.
"The flip side of all of this is that we shame any boys (and, to a certain extent, girls) who participate in activities or behaviors that are seen as being more ""feminine""."
I can't tell you the number of parents I've seen who think they've somehow failed at feminism because their daughters like lace and Barbie dolls; it's much rarer to see the parent of a boy upset because his love of Batman and Star Wars doesn't sufficiently challenge gender roles.
"This devaluation of femininity is why everyone was fine with Izzy's Iron Man tattoo, but balked at my son's appreciation of My Little Pony."
"It's less about enforcing rigidly defined gender roles on boys and girls, and more about straight up misogyny."
"Anything regarded as ""feminine"" is still seen by men and women alike as occupying a lower status."
We see the devaluation of femininity play out in tons of different ways.
"For example, as sailor mercury mentions in her post, there's the whole trope of ""you throw/run/play like a girl,"" not to mention the fact that ""girl"" is routinely used as an insult among boys and men."
"Women are advised to tone down their femininity—less ruffles, less makeup, less flashy jewelry; more dark suits with clean lines—if they want to be taken seriously at their jobs."
"And while the backlash against the hyper-gendering of little girls—the ubiquitousness of Princess Culture, puffy skirts and a color palette that veers strongly towards pink—is very much needed, there is occasionally an anti-femme tone that creeps into the discourse."
"The thing is, there's nothing wrong with pastel colors or fluffy little tutus; problems arise when we use these things to push certain gender expectations on girls."
"For example, Amazon sells a ""medical kit"" that comes in shades of pink and mauve, which is super sucky on one level because it sends the not-so-subtle message that girls need some kind of special girl equipment in order to be girl doctors."
"But on another level, there is nothing objectively wrong with a pink stethoscope."
"When people ask ""Why can't girls just play with a regular doctor kit""?"
"I mean, I know why, but it's frustrating to constantly see the more masculine-leaning version of any given toy being hailed as the status quo, while the feminine version is pooh-poohed as being silly and unnecessary."
Gender equality doesn't mean that everything has to be androgynous.
It means that all the girly things we've been taught to have such disdain for should be seen as being just as good as all the masculine stuff we self-described patriarchy-hating folks continue to embrace.
The way forward isn't to teach girls to be more like boys—that's just the same old patriarchal shit of privileging masculinity over femininity.
"Instead, we should be teaching all kids that wearing skirts and loving pink and wanting cuddly baby dolls are totally cool and fine ways to be."
There's nothing inherently bad about being femme; problems arise when we try to enforce femininity on people as a means of oppression.
"We feminists tell ourselves that we're trying to break down the gender binary, which is for sure an admirable idea that should be tackled with enthusiasm."
"But as we move towards viewing gender as more of a spectrum, we need to make sure that spectrum includes the color pink."
"The concept of ‘gender neutral’ has grown fast in the new millennium, with young Asian customers leading the pack by buying the same clothes in a single shop off the same rail."
But to find the idea of ‘gender neutral’ as a fashion reality in the world’s largest menswear marketplace is a quiet revolution.
"They swept the worn stone floor of the Stazione Leopolda, before these female shapes were followed by more futuristic sports clothes, some printed with ‘human error’ or ‘computer malfunction’ and others with plastic hoods covering the face, adding a feeling of ‘outer space’ which echoed Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey."
"The end of the show went back to skirts: long, draped and white, suggesting the gender fluidity of these young men."
Hard to tell with the faces covered by hoods as if facing a post-apocalyptic future where gender might be irrelevant.
"What exactly does ‘gender neutral’ mean, when human bodies are drawn in their own natural shapes?"
"I would describe this current look as a deliberate approach of different sexes to make themselves appear similar, or at least not to be defined by clothes that signal a rigid binary view of gender."
"The result of CEO Claudio Del Vecchio’s vision was grandiose, dutifully up-to-date with a mix of races on the runway and some female models to prove that this was not all a man’s world."
"But womenswear designer Zac Posen might have done more, while still focusing on quality, to push gender neutral looks further forward than a woman’s elegantly tailored camel coat and matching skirt."
"By contrast, the male styling made simple pieces – like a cable-knit cardigan tucked into tailored trousers – look weird."
"Finland, like other Nordic countries, has a sharing of spirit and action between the sexes."
"And it seemed natural that among this year’s guest nation for Pitti Immagine, husband and wife team Niina and Timo Leskelä showed with casual style how the same garment can be worn by both men and women."
"“We think ‘humans’ – Finland has been really democratic and we are sexually equal,” said Niina."
There is not so big a difference between men and women.
"Also, I am the CEO of our brand, which is important to us because we want more women bosses!"
"Perhaps when gender neutrality becomes a reality in each family, the male-female divide – at least in fashion – really will be stitched together."
Finnish design team Timo and Niina Leskelä whose label Nomen Nescio blurs the divide between menswear and womenswear
"In the last few months, I’ve heard several of my female executive clients complain about the lack of real opportunities in their organizations."
The glass ceiling is actually made of concrete.
"You need heavy equipment to blast it open, one of them told me — only half-jokingly."
"My biggest concern is that when that kind of comment comes from women who work at companies that are investing in female talent development, what can we expect from organizations that are not even there yet?"
"Here’s the problem: If you’re only paying lip service to gender inclusion, you will pay dearly in loss of top talent and loss of reputation with your customers."
"It’s no longer possible to live a duplicitous corporate life where you pride yourself on all you’re doing to advance gender inclusion in the workplace, while your employees leave for greener pastures."
"Before you establish leadership development programs, make sure you have real opportunities for your team."
"As I mentioned, even companies that are devoting resources to provide training programs for their associates are guilty of not offering a clear career path once those women are ready for the next step."
"Seen from the perspective of someone who invested her effort and limited time to complete a training program, it can be extremely frustrating."
There’s truly only so much that you can do to convince women to keep trying different strategies to land the promotion they seek.
The situation is even more sensitive when these women are executives who sit at meetings where they witness a constant reinforcement of an old-school mentality that contradicts everything the organization professes to be doing — when they see a homogenous group making all the decisions and getting the top positions time and again.
Avoid frustrating your top talent and turning it against you when they question your true intentions.
"Although gender is certainly not the only key to brand success, it might be one of the most effective tools when it comes to creating a clear brand personality."
"The fact that my first Barbie house was shiny and pink, does not mean I like my tool box, laptop or telephone shiny and pink."
"I can appreciate a masculine product or brand, and do not see the need to “pink it & shrink it”."
"In fact, it would be awesome to drive a Porsche or a Harley-Davidson sometime."
"Harley’s CFO John Olin expressed this feeling well: “A lot of women, I guess, like to be bad asses as well”."
"Similarly, my boyfriend likes Dove and he is not the only male fan."
"Dove was one of the top-5 most desired brands in 2012, among women ­­­­and men."
"So if men are able to desire feminine brands and women can value masculine brands, does gender matter at all?"
"In an online study, 130,000 consumers rated 140 well-known brands on masculinity and femininity—and evaluated the brand equity."
Brand equity can be seen as the incremental utility of the branded product compared with a non-branded equivalent.
The scientists did not find a difference in preferences between masculine or feminine brands.
"However, the results show that masculine and feminine brands have higher brand equity and preference than gender-neutral brands, regardless of the product category."
"More interestingly, the results were not influenced by the gender of the consumer."
"Males preferred feminine brands as well as masculine brands, over gender-neutral brands."
"Likewise, females evaluated brands with a higher degree of femininity or masculinity more positively."
The study also shows that the gender of a brand does not have to be similar to the gender of the target audience.
One of world’s most masculine brands started to target the rising group of female riders.
"The brand did not reduce the masculinity to gain women’s interest, but reduced the barriers to ride a Harley by hosting riding courses and “Garage parties” where women gathered to learn motorcycle skills."
Sexual identity is one of the most clear personality traits of humans.
Gender-specific stimuli evoke associations and give an idea of one’s personality.
Highly masculine or feminine brands evoke more positive associations and are more preferred than gender-neutral brands.
"A high degree of masculinity/femininity increases the associations and therefore creates a clearer brand personality, which eventually leads to higher preference."
"Gender is efficient in clarifying brand personality, but it is not the only thing that counts."
Numerous Best Global Brands create clear brand personalities without having a specific gender.
"Obviously, many more aspects determine Brand Value and preference, than gender or personality alone."
A clear gender evokes more favorable association and increases brand preference.
"Therefore, it might be worthwhile to think of gender when evaluating or (re)positioning a brand."
Embrace your brand’s femininity or masculinity.
It does not matter whether brands are masculine or feminine.
"A specific gender clarifies the personality, increases associations and preference; regardless of gender of the target group."
"Brand gender does not stand alone, but interacts with the entire brand."
Explore what personality and gender would be most authentic for your brand.
Gender-neutral brands might face a bigger challenge to create a clear brand personality.
"Yet, a brand personality can include many other attributes than gender alone."
"Brands require a clear and consistent focus towards the brand personality, gender-neutral brands in particular."
"However, there are only 29 million new entries coming into the workforce, leaving over 23 million jobs to fill."
"Most of these jobs are knowledge based jobs, and with women being among the better educated group of new entries into the workforce, the vast majority of jobs will go to them."
Gender stereotypes suggest that men are usually tough and women are usually tender.
"A new study published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, finds these stereotypes have some real bodily truth for our brains; when people look at a gender-neutral face, they are more likely to judge it as male if they’re touching something hard and as female if they’re touching something soft."
"Each face had been made to look exactly gender-neutral, so it was neither male nor female."
"For each face, the volunteer had to categorize it as male or female."
"People who were squeezing the soft ball were more likely to judge faces as female, while people who handled the hard ball were more likely to categorize them as male."
"People who were pressing hard were more likely to categorize faces as male, while the soft writers were more likely to choose female."
"“We were really surprised,” says Slepian, who cowrote the study with Max Weisbuch of the University of Denver, Nicholas O. Rule at the University of Toronto, and Nalini Ambady of Tufts University."
"The results show that knowledge about social categories, such as gender, is like other kinds of knowledge—it’s partly carried in the body."
They're smack in the middle of childhood but old enough to have sage views on gender.
"Here, kids from all over the world share what they like about being boys and girls and what they wish could be different."
"If you want candid answers about how gender shapes destiny, ask the world's nine-year-olds."
"At nine, a girl in Kenya already knows that her parents will marry her off for a dowry, to a man who may beat her."
"At nine, a boy in India already knows he'll be pressured by male pals to sexually harass women in the street."
"At nine, youngsters from China to Canada and Kenya to Brazil describe big dreams for future careers' but the boys don't see their gender as an impediment, while the girls, all too frequently, do."
"On the cusp of change, in that last anteroom of childhood before adolescence, nine-year-olds don't think in terms of demographic statistics or global averages."
"But when they talk about their lives, it's clear: Children at this age are unquestionably taking account of their own possibilities and the limits gender places on them."
"To get kids' perspectives, National Geographic fanned out into 80 homes over four continents."
"Many readily admitted that it can be hard, frustrating, confusing, lonely to fit into the communities they call home and the roles they<re expected to play."
Others are thriving as they break down gender barriers.
What's the best thing about being a girl?
Avery Jackson swipes a rainbow-streaked wisp of hair from her eyes and considers the question.
Everything about being a girl is good!
What's the worst thing about being a girl?
"How boys always say, ""That stuff isn't girl stuff, it's boy stuff."""
"Like when I first did parkour, an obstacle-course sport."
"Avery spent the first four years of her life as a boy, and was miserable; she still smarts recalling how she lost her preschool friends because their moms did not like me."
"Living since 2012 as an openly transgender girl, the Kansas City native is now at ground zero in the evolving conversation about gender roles and rights."
The grown-ups talk about it but kids like Avery want to have their say too.
"Nine-year-olds can be impressively articulate and wise, says Theresa Betancourt, associate professor of child health and human rights at Harvard University."
"They face increased peer pressure and responsibility, she says, but not the conformity and self-censorship that come with adolescence."
"For Yiqi Wang in Beijing, the best thing about being a girl is that we're more calm and reliable than boys."
How might your life be different if you were a girl instead of a boy (or a boy instead of a girl)?
"Lev Hershberg says that if he were a girl, he wouldn't like computers."
"Fellow Israeli Shimon Perel says if he were a girl, he could play with a jump rope."
"If they were boys, Pooja Pawara from outside Mumbai would ride a scooter, while Yan Zhu from China's Yaqueshui village would swim in a river that her grandmother insists is too cold for girls."
"Because she's not a boy, Luandra Montovani isn't allowed to play in her Rio favela's streets, where she says the dangers include violence and stray bullets."
"Eriah Big Crow, an Oglala Lakota who lives on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, says in a near whisper that there's nothing that she can't do, because boys and girls are exactly the same."
"Eriah's claim might sound too optimistic to Anju Malhotra, UNICEF's principal adviser on gender and development."
"With respect to gender inequality, she says, we're not seeing an expiration date for it yet but there is progress."
"For global citizens under age 10, recent decades have seen more gender equity in areas such as primary school education access, says UNICEF's Claudia Cappa."
"But statisticians can count only those who were able to survive, she notes, and sex-selective abortions of female fetuses persist in some countries."
"Things change completely in adolescence, Cappa says, with striking gender gaps in access to secondary schools, for example, or exposure to early marriage and violence."
"This is when you stop being a child, she says."
You become a female or a male.

"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada put women front and center in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, he surprised some people."
"After all, the annual forum is a male-dominated event if there ever was one."
Women make up a fifth of participants.
"“I’d like to focus on a fundamental shift that every leader in this room can act on immediately, one that I have made a central tenet of my leadership,” Mr. Trudeau told a packed room in Davos."
"“I’m talking about hiring, promoting and retaining more women."""
"In Canada, reducing the gender gap could result in $150 billion more in annual economic output by 2026, according to McKinsey & Company, he added."
"Fifty years ago, the swimsuit-wearing beauties of the Miss America pageant were confronted with a spectacle on the Atlantic City boardwalk: 100 feminists throwing bras, girdles, curling irons, false eyelashes and other “instruments of female torture” into a trash can labeled “Freedom”."
"The protesters had planned to set the can on fire but could not get the right permits — so, alas, no bras were burned that summer day, though it is the origin of the term “bra burning”."
"They were condemning what even then they saw as an antiquated institution, which had mostly male judges scrutinize women’s bodies, women of color at one point not allowed to compete, corporations profiting on the event, and three in four American households watching it all happen on television."
"“Everybody tuned into Miss America back then — this was like the Oscars,” said the author Alix Kates Shulman, 85, one of the organizers of that 1968 protest."
"Younger generations may be getting dumber by the year, according to a study which suggests the trend of IQs going up with each generation may be reversing."
"The Flynn effect refers to the trend of a gradual rise of about three points each decade in average IQs, which has been observed for 70 years."
"But scientists at the Raglar Frisch Centre for Economic Research in Norway analysed the IQs of 730,000 men in national service during 1970 and 2009 and found a drop equivalent of seven points per generation."
"Based on the ages of the men, it appears to have started with the generation born about 1975, coming of age in the 1990s."
One high school student is refusing to be silenced by her high school administration.
"Petaluma High School senior Lulabel Seitz was delivering her valedictorian speech during the school’s June 2 graduation ceremony in Petaluma, California, when her microphone was abruptly muted."
"Seitz, 17, said it was turned off by the school’s administration because she attempted to talk about her experience of being sexually assaulted at school."
"Once she realized her mic had been muted, Seitz moved to the end of the stage where she attempted to continue her speech."
"Her classmates stood up and applauded in support, later chanting “Let her speak!"
The valedictorian moved in front of the podium and finished her speech before sitting down.
"Seitz, who is headed to Stanford University in the fall, told The Press Democrat that she was sexually assaulted on school grounds by someone she knows."
She said that school administrators did nothing despite her making a formal complaint.

"Sarai Walker has been fielding a lot of questions about body image recently, and there are some for which she still doesn’t have an answer."
The character Plum in the new TV series based on Sarai Walker’s novel is neither the butt of jokes nor an object of pity – and she feels revolutionary
"The author of the feminist instant classic, Dietland, now adapted into a 10-part TV series, was asked at a Q&A which movie characters she has seen herself in."
"“My answer,” she says, “was: ‘I’ve never seen that’ … I’ve never had that connection, a character that reflected me as a fat person."
Plum isn’t overweight in the usual Hollywood sense – think Jan from Grease (a regular-sized woman wearing a thick jumper) or Amy Schumer in the recently released film I Feel Pretty.
"Plum is fat, and the story centres on the diet industry, objectification, fat shaming, terrorism and feminist rage."
"Watching TV and film from a fat perspective – and particularly a fat woman’s perspective – can be like gazing through a looking glass into a world where you and those who look like you don’t exist (male characters are allowed more leeway with their weight, although fat men on screen are certainly stigmatised, too)."
"When a fat female character does squeeze into the narrow frame the entertainment industry has created, reasons for their uncomfortable presence swiftly follow, because no fat woman in mainstream cinema and television is just fat – that extra flesh has to serve a purpose."
"The first time I noticed this was while watching a US crime drama years ago, one of those that features a death on the beach or at a fashion show every week, so the skinny, sexy corpse can wear a bikini."
My vague memory is that the victim was a teenage girl who had died in a poisoned prom dress.
"The killer had been a fat girl, jealous of her victim."
"Watching these shows, you soon figure out that if a fat person shows up, they have probably killed someone because of their own self-hatred."
"In the 90s, if a new girl showed up on the teen shows California Dreams or Saved by the Bell who didn’t fit the standard template for a love interest for protagonists Sly and Zack, it was a safe bet she was there for Very Special Episode reasons."
"When Walker was growing up, fat women on screen embodied tragedy, particularly when they were female celebrities."
"“I came of age in the 90s,” she says, “when every fat person in the media was trying to lose weight, always portrayed as miserable and desperate to be thin”."
"It’s easy to remember famous female faces who have sold that message of misery, so perpetually is it played out through magazines, talkshows and diet ads."
Then she switches to a more angry person.
A lot of people were responding to – and were comfortable with – the fact that she’s the ‘miserable fatty’.
"But when she becomes a badass and fights back, they’re uncomfortable – because she’s not miserable, it’s very disorientating."
They might like to think about why that makes them uncomfortable”.
We are not supposed to be angry; that is not what the messages we all receive tell us.
"Programmes such as My 600lb Life and The Biggest Loser (shows that Roxane Gay, in her memoir Hunger, deemed “anti-obesity propaganda” – as well as “wish fulfilment”) are a message to fat people that they can change, but more importantly, that they should."
"Fat is wrong, fat is shameful, fat people are miserable and shouldn’t exist – unless it is for entertainment purposes."
This was a serious consideration when she was fielding offers from TV companies.
"She doesn’t serve as a lesson for other characters before disappearing in time for the next episode, and we are not invited to look at her with pity or cruel laughter – she just exists, as herself, as Plum."
The nicknames yelled at fat people are a reminder of the times they have tried: Jabba the Hutt; Ursula (The Little Mermaid); The Penguin; the dancer in Return of the Jedi with six tits; Big Bertha the Bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar (Super Mario Bros); Sherman Klump (The Nutty Professor); Tracy Turnblad (Hairspray); Precious; the fat vampire from Blade.
"When putting her own list together, the writer Lindy West searched hard for a positive fat role model and finally came up with Mrs Potts from Beauty and the Beast."
"“I’m hoping [for] a change in the culture,” says Walker, of Dietland’s debut, “that we’re going to see more fat people and smarter portrayals of fat people”."
"The airline industry wants to attract more women, but no one seems to have told the trade body's new chairman."
"Akbar Al Baker, International Air Transport Association chair and chief executive of Qatar Airways, said his job could only be done by a man."
"""Of course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position,"" Mr Baker said."
He said Qatar Airways was the first carrier in the Middle East to have female pilots and that the company had women in senior roles.
So we actually encourage women.
"Mr Baker also said that he would welcome a female leader, providing he could train her up."
"""It will be my pleasure to have a female CEO candidate I could then develop to become CEO after me,"" he told Bloomberg."
It's not the first time that the Qatar Airways boss has sparked controversy.
"Last year, Mr Baker was forced to apologise ""unreservedly"" for his unflattering description of US flight attendants as ""grandmothers""."
"In contrast, he had said the average age of Qatar Airways cabin crews was 26 in comments criticised as both sexist and ageist."
Gender equality in the notoriously male-dominated airline industry was a big theme at the IATA annual meeting.
"Alan Joyce, the gay chief executive of Qantas Airways who campaigned for marriage equality in Australia, had sat next to Mr Baker at a session on the topic."
"Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways-owner IAG, said the industry needed to attract more women and that progress had been slow."
Aer Lingus recruited its first female pilot in 1977.
A Facebook executive apologized to a woman for calling her “not nice” after she asked questions at the company’s annual shareholder meeting about the social network’s gender pay gap and the proliferation of sexism on the platform.
"The email came over the weekend ? more than a week after the incident ? ahead of a column Lamb published in the Financial Times on Monday, pointing out the overt sexism involved in dismissing a woman’s concerns because of her demeanor."
The idea that girls and women must be nice is one of the more pernicious stereotypes holding females back in the workplace.
"“I cannot imagine a scenario where a male company executive ignores a male institutional investor with such an excuse,” Lamb wrote in the column, noting that Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has waged a campaign against coded gender language."
“I was dismissed in a sexist way for trying to call Facebook out on problems that are specifically related to gender”.
"Over the past three years, Lamb has been running a campaign to press public companies to reveal their gender pay data."
"Her group has gotten 20 major public companies to disclose pay data, including Apple, Amazon, Citigroup and Bank of America."
"Facebook has been a tough nut to crack, she said."
"This is the third year that Lamb has raised the issue of gender pay reporting at the company’s shareholder meeting ? and the second year that she’s asked the company to consider a policy on “content governance,” in light of the way Facebook was used by groups to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and also the issue of hate speech and sexism on the platform."
"Lamb says Facebook has been unwilling to talk about its pay gap, beyond telling her that it pays men and women equally."
"Facebook, for its part, told HuffPost that it disagrees with Lamb and that the company has been engaging in discussions with her for several years."
"As she acknowledges herself, Facebook has engaged with her several times on these issues ? in 2016, 2017 and 2018, including two days before the recent shareholder meeting,” spokeswoman Vanessa Chan said in an email."
"“Facebook pays women and men the same” for the same work, she said, “and we’re also committed to increasing the number of women and people from other underrepresented groups across the company”."
Facebook has announced that it pays men and women equally for the past three years.
"However, 72 percent of the company’s senior leaders are male ? suggesting that overall men outearn women at the company because they’re landing the highest-paying roles."
"“He said we haven’t been engaging with you because you haven’t been nice,” Lamb said."
"“They’re not listening to us because we’re ‘not nice,’” Lamb said."
“It’s because they don’t want to hear what we have to say”.
"Qatar Airways can’t be run by a woman, according to its current CEO, Akbar Al Baker."
"During the International Air Transport Association’s annual conference in Sydney on Monday, a reporter asked Al Baker what he plans to do to bring more gender equality to airlines and bring more women into high-level positions, specifically in Middle Eastern airline companies."
"“Well, it’s not in Qatar Airways,” Al Baker said of gender inequality in aviation, to which the reporter responded: “Well, certainly it’s being led by a man?"
Of course it has to be led by a man because it is a very challenging position
"Al Baker, who’s been the CEO of Qatar Airways since 1997, was named chairman of the IATA’s board of governors for a one-year term just moments before his controversial comments."
A British aviator who is known online as Charlotte The Pilot hit back at two male passengers who’d insulted women pilots on a recent flight: This female pilot is using Twitter to call out two sexist passengers.
‘I wont make any jokes about female drivers then’ ‘Are you the pilot?
"If I’d know that I wouldnt have got on’ Fact is, I can fly an £80m jet, you can’t."
"“Baffled as to why 2 male pax felt that these comments were necessary,” Charlotte Knowlson wrote, before sharing their sexist remarks about women flying aircraft."
"In subsequent tweets, Knowlson revealed her initial response was to “be professional, laugh and ask them if they were enjoying the flight”."
"She rethought her stance, however, after a flight attendant “expressed her anger”."
"The kind of attitude exhibited by those passengers puts women off pursuing careers in male-dominated industries, she said."
Knowlson added that she “didn’t get where I am today by listening to these kinds of comments”.
“I’m saddened by the fact that this is the attitude some still have and think it is ok to make these comments to women”.
"Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are seeking to clear the air as a prominent Baptist’s past remarks about women, abuse, and divorce come newly under scrutiny."
"Paige Patterson, president of Texas’ Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a major figure in America’s largest Protestant denomination, admitted Thursday that his description of a teenage girl’s body as “nice” in recently resurfaced footage of a 2014 sermon had “obviously been hurtful to women”."
"“I wish to apologize to every woman who has been wounded by anything I have said that was inappropriate or that lacked clarity,” Patterson wrote in a statement on his seminary’s website."
"In his 2014 talk, Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a 16-year-old girl’s body."
"To illustrate how God “beautifully and artistically” created women, he recalled a time when he saw “a very attractive” 16-year-old walking by after he’d preached at an event."
"“She was nice,” Patterson reminisced in the clip, remarking that another man had described her as “built”."
He has used the same story more than once over the years.
"On Thursday, Patterson apologized for his words."
"“Please forgive the failure to be as thoughtful and careful in my extemporaneous expression as I should have been,” the pastor wrote in his statement."
Patterson’s apology did not directly address another remark he’s made that has been causing controversy within Southern Baptist circles.
He was captured on tape in 2000 advising physically abused wives to avoid divorce whenever possible and to “be submissive in every way”.
He’s clarified since that he has counseled women to leave ? albeit not to divorce ? their abusive husbands.
"In his apology, Patterson did not address the possibility of divorce as an option for women in abusive relationships."
"He did, however, explicitly condemn all forms of abuse."
"“I utterly reject any form of abuse in demeaning or threatening talk, in physical blows, or in forced sexual acts,” he wrote in his statement on Thursday."
“There is no excuse for anyone to use intemperate language or to attempt to injure another person”.
"As a former president of the entire denomination, he’s credited with leading it toward greater conservatism."
"Some Southern Baptists are calling for Patterson to resign from his seminary position and withdraw from other duties, such as delivering the sermon at the denomination’s annual meeting in Dallas this June."
"A petition condemning Patterson’s “damaging, sinful” comments has gathered over 3,000 signatures, mostly from evangelical women."
Others are offering their support for Patterson.
Female professors and students at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary say he has been a champion for women at their school.
A SHOCKINGLY sexist reply-all email sent by the boss of a Hollywood talent agency has gone viral after being posted on Facebook by the accidental recipient.
"Rosette Laursen, who has since quit the agency, was working as an assistant when she asked for a day off to take part in “A Day Without A Woman”, an initiative on International Women’s Day on March 8 to demonstrate the value women bring to the modern workplace."
Someone should sew her vagina shut.
I’m never hiring a girl ever again.
No bonus for anyone that strikes or leaves early in pilot season.
No one is striking in show business we are all against Trump.
And women are considered diverse and being shoved in as writer and directors.
Heather went to work.
I’m sure anyone at a casting office or agency would be fired.
She then received the following apology: “I apologize for venting like a misogynistic fa***t.
I was letting off steam I didn’t mean to hit reply all.
"Ms Laursen said she “wasn’t a big fan of any of this”, and responded with “I quit”."
"“One of my male co-workers, obviously realising he would be experiencing ‘a day without a woman’ for the indefinite future and would have to do more work, encouraged me to come back into the office saying, ‘It was just a joke,’” she wrote."
"“My co-workers had worked there for years and my only guess is that they slowly became desensitised to [the boss’] behaviour to the point where the line of what is normal or acceptable didn’t just blur, it disappeared."
I’m sure those girls who led random victims to Charles Manson to be murdered could also be really fun at a game night playing cards against humanity”.
"Ms Laursen added that the “response shouldn’t have surprised me considering my past exchanges with him”, but described the email as the “final straw”."
"She added that her Christmas bonus that year was red lingerie that “made me look like a ham”, but pointed out that her boss “is gay so it could be weirder”."
"“He could be kind of terrible,” she wrote."
"“However, sometimes he was actually really cool and funny and nice ."
"Good qualities aside, a majority of the time he was screaming terrific things like the N word at the top of his lungs while describing black clients who were frustrating him."
"“He would call his employees ‘f***ing retards’, and scream he is never friends with women."
"Then it would slowly dawn upon him that he maybe took things a little too far, and he would say, ‘I was just joking."
"Ms Laursen said she had originally intended to tell her story anonymously, but “the truth is, I stand proudly by everything I’ve written”."
"“If someone chooses not to hire me because of this, it will likely save us both from a weird workplace fit,” she wrote."
If someone doesn’t want to be my friend because of this I respectfully understand that our differences would probably come between us sooner or later and we should probably spend our time with like minded people.
I value and respect who I am and I want to be surrounded by people who value and respect me too.
"And my boss was a woman, unfortunately."
As soon as I read the sexist emails from Richard Scudamore I knew my position as his PA was untenable.
I couldn't face him.
"He felt comfortable sending those messages, which included vulgar and sexist conversations about female colleagues, and he didn't censor his language even though he knew I'd see them."
I've never felt that way in the workplace before.
I wanted to talk to the HR department but felt that if I did it would be covered up.
I was on a contract and thought that they'd probably just get rid of me.
My mum always taught me to speak up for what I believe in.
"I've tried to steer clear of social media since the story broke, but a lot of people seem to think it's a trivial matter."
"Their tone has been, ""What's wrong with her, it's a sexist joke, get over it""."
I believe Scudamore's emails are very different from men having a laugh at the pub.
"It feels like there's been a real injustice, that they're not taking any notice of what he did."
"The committee is made up of men only, and many are friends of Scudamore who have known him a long time."
The fact that an issue of women suffering sexism is being decided by an all-male panel speaks volumes.
I'm not saying I want him to resign.
"But I would say he should apologise properly, with a genuine acknowledgement that what he did was wrong – I expect that, at the very least."
"Though Scudamore operates in a predominantly male sport, in his role he's supposed to be promoting women's football."
Working with women is part of his job.
"When one of my new colleagues saw the article in the paper she told me: ""I suffered similar behaviour from a boss at my old workplace, so I left""."
"I now realise there must be so many women who have gone through that kind of experience in all types of workplaces, and continue to endure it, without speaking up because they're afraid."
"Some who are made to feel uncomfortable and have to leave, and others who suffer in silence because they're scared of losing their jobs."
In all businesses women have to work really hard to get to senior positions.
"So to have someone with Scudamore's attitudes leading an organisation, and then for that organisation to back him 100%, is a kick in the teeth for all women."
I hope there's someone in power who can persuade the Premier League to reconsider their decision.
"And for David Cameron to take time out to comment on the revelations shows that he cares about the issue, and understands it's not acceptable."
"Though I would like to think that the publicity over Scudamore will have a knock-on effect on other workplaces, and make sexist bosses think twice about their language and attitudes to women, I also fear that maybe the Premier League's decision will send out another signal entirely and bosses will think: ""If Richard Scudamore can get away with it, so could I."" Even now, I'm nervous about what will happen; but no matter how things pan out, I'm glad I did the right thing."
I've no regrets that I took my mother's advice.
"An outgoing advertising executive ranked his female colleagues by attractiveness in an email sent to his entire office, in the latest episode of sexist behavior to rock a British workplace."
"In the email, the executive split staff into a “Top Five” and “Bottom Five”, commenting on how many pints of beer he would need to have sex with them."
"Paul Martin, the departing creative strategist at The&Partnership agency, said he had intended to mock sexism."
"However, he acknowledged that the email, sent on International Women’s Day last week and later published by newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Times, had “totally missed the mark”."
"Emboldened by campaigns such as the MeToo social media movement, many women are expressing anger at years of abusive treatment, pay that lags behind men and workplace cultures that make them feel uncomfortable or threatened."
"Women have complained about colleagues’ behavior in many North American and British institutions, companies and industries including Hollywood, the media, financial services and in parliament."
A spokeswoman said it actively invested in and promoted women at all levels.
"Its three London agencies are all run by women, its media network in North America is run by two women, and it has female managing directors and heads of department across the business, she said."
"Martin said he had intended the email as a way to mock a common tradition in British advertising of sending such messages, but added that it had “understandably offended and upset many people”."
"“I take full and sole responsibility for this and sincerely apologize for all offense this has caused,” he said in a statement."
"“The email was meant to be a stupid, ironic attempt to subvert and mock the sexist ‘Top Five’ emails that have been sent around agencies for many years but I have totally missed the mark and take full responsibility”."
A Hollywood talent manager has issued a public apology for sexist emails he sent to a former employee which have gone viral after she posted them to Facebook.
"Rosette Laursen was working as an assistant at Michael Enfield Management when, in response to a request for a day off, she accidentally received a set of emails that were meant for her male co-workers, one of which read: “Are you f*cking kidding me."
The email exchange didn't end there with another reading: No bonus for anyone that strikes or leaves early in pilot season.
"I believe deeply in workplace diversity regardless of race, gender, creed or sexual orientation, and I am mortified that the things I have said have worked against my commitment to inclusion."
The actresses fighting against sexism in Hollywood 12 show all The actresses fighting against sexism in Hollywood 1/12 Anne Hathaway The 32-year-old actress said she has already experiences job rejections because of her age.
Women and men are not equal.
"Honestly, it’s so annoying."
"We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger."
"Gyllenhaal revealed she was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, aged 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man."
Meryl Streep has helped fund an all-female screenwriters group called The Writer’s Lab to encourage more women to pen Hollywood scripts.
Once women pass childbearing age they could only be seen as grotesque on some level.
Hollywood is “still completely s**** when it comes to treating women equally to men.
"And when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women, and I find that very disturbing and sad."
Banks said she was driven from acting to directing due to the lack of roles for older women in Hollywood.
"""I mean look at Gwyneth Paltrow who has her Oscar [for Shakespeare in Love] and played fifth banana to Iron Man,” she told Deadline."
"I had never seen a 49-year-old, dark-skinned woman who is not a size 2 be a sexualised role in TV or film."
"I'm a sexual woman, but nothing in my career has ever identified me as a sexualised woman."
The Lord of the Rings actress said she only get cast in roles where she is treated as a “second class citizen” at the age of 38.
"“When you’re in your teens or twenties, there is an abundance of ingenue parts which are exciting to play,"" she told More magazine."
"""But at [my age], you’re usually the wife or the girlfriend - a sort of second-class citizen,"" she told More magazine."
"""There are more interesting roles for women when they get a bit older,” she told More magazine."
The actress famously called out sexism on the red carpet at the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards.
"When a camera operator scanned her up and down, she said: “Do you do this to the guys?"
"In her Oscar acceptance speech for Blue Jasmine, she reminded the film industry that movies with leading women can still be successful."
"Those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films, with women at the centre, are niche experiences."
"Ellen Page Asked if she had ever encountered sexism in Hollywood, Page told The Guardian: ‘Oh my God, yeah!"
"If you're a girl and you don't fit the very specific vision of what a girl should be, which is always from a man's perspective, then you're a little bit at a loss."
"The actress says she refuses roles where she has to play the generic girlfriend, wife or sexy bombshell."
"It's very hard being a woman in a man's world, and I recognised it was a man's world even when I was a kid."
"The actress spoke to ELLE about negotiating equal pay for the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel: ""This is a good time for us to bring this to a place of fairness, and girls need to know that being a feminist is a good thing."
I apologise for venting like a misogynistic faggot.
"An Australian 60 Minutes piece on Jacinda Ardern has hit the headlines for its patronising and ""cringe-worthy"" treatment of her role as prime minister."
He also asked Ms Ardern and partner Clarke Gayford when the baby was due and then went to question if the baby was conceived during the election campaign.
"Mr Martin thanked his colleagues for “a fun couple of years” — but then proceeded to rank his female co-workers in a list of “top five” and “bottom five”, based on their appearance."
He wrote that he would only find one woman attractive “after seven pints and a bag of pork scratchings”.
"“If you were the last girl on earth, I would use you as bait to trap a wild animal I would be happier f***ing”."
"“If it were, there might be some right munters in there and that would defeat the whole point of trying to sexistly objectify people (on International Women’s Day, of all days)”."
"He signed off his email by saying he is heading to the pub after work, “And if anyone in my Top Five fancy leaving their partners and risking it all for a bit of ‘mental’, then my contacts are below and scrawled crudely across most public bathrooms”."
“We do not condone sexism of any kind at The & Partnership LDN”.
It doesn’t take a Don Draper to work out that listing the names of the women in your advertising agency in descending order of attractiveness and sending it around the office in an email is not a winning strategy.
"In a farewell email to colleagues, Paul Martin, the departing creative strategist at The&Partnership, categorised his female colleagues at the agency’s London office into lists, entitled, “Top Five”, “Bottom Five” and “If I’d Had A Few Too Many”, joking exactly how many pints he would have to drink before he would consider sleeping with them."
"Paul Martin, who worked at The &Partnership, sent the message on his last day, which included a list of 'Top Five' and 'Bottom Five' female colleagues."
"If you were the last girl on earth, I would use you as bait to trap a wild animal I would be happier f******."
"When ranking his colleagues according to their looks, he added: 'Please bear in mind that this is based solely on looks and has nothing to do with personality; if it were, there might be some right munters in there and that would defeat the whole point of trying to sexistly objectify people'"
"Mr Martin , whose Twitter bio describes him as a 'lifelong ginger sufferer', claims the email was intended as a joke and a 'stupid, ironic attempt' at mocking macho culture."
He listed his female colleagues by order of attractiveness - with both a top five and a bottom five .
"Fellow advertising creative Nathalie Gordon wrote: 'So I've just heard that 3 of the biggest agencies in London are making people send an all-staff email when they leave, which includes a 'Top 5' of people they either think are attractive/would sleep with."
One crude comment said Mr Martin would only find one attractive 'after seven pints and a bag of pork scratchings'
"The departing advertising worker apologised for his behaviour on Twitter, which included calling female staff 'munters'"
I've seen that some women are worried about the repercussions of 'naming and shaming but please don't.
We do not condone sexism of any kind at The&Partnership LDN.
"Many of these women are actively involved in multiple initiatives to support, promote and empower women across the advertising and media industries."
"For the last few days, Donatella Garofalo has been reviewing Quebec’s sex education curriculum, marking off the parts she feels are inappropriate for her nine-year-old son."
"Garofalo is concerned the new program will teach children in kindergarten about pregnancy and birth – more specifically, about how the egg and sperm cells meet and what the different types of birth women can have."
Quebec's sex education curriculum aims to introduce seven and eight-year-old children to the phenomenon of conception and sexual intercourse.
"During sex education, eight and nine-year-old kids will learn about emotional and romantic life topics, such as sexual interest and student aged 11 and 12 will learn about sexual arousal."
"Online porn, sexting should be included in sex education curriculum"
"I am not OK with our five until 10-year-olds to know what sex is, and how children are born, and romantic life,” said Garofalo."
"Other topics in the province’s sex ed curriculum include: Human body: male and female The scope of human sexuality Roles, sexual stereotypes and social norms Puberty and body image Human sexual growth and body image Sexual exploitation Emotional and romantic relationships Sexual awakening Sexual violence Sexual health Sexual health and the expression of human sexuality"
"Rude, crude, sexist and often mean-spirited--even Howard Stern has complaints--the site has become a go-to for young men who say they are disenfranchised by the mainstream media."
"Ignoring the entreaties of the capacity crowd assembled here at Boston's House of Blues, Portnoy sits inside the club's greenroom hunched over a borrowed laptop, his attention focused on blogging photos of a shirt-less fat guy in a Lucha Libre wrestling mask and cape, captured just moments ago at that night's Boston Red Sox/Baltimore Orioles game and sent in by a member of Barstool's rabid fan base."
"Several male members of the Barstool staff squeeze into ill-fitting, sweat-encrusted Smurfs and Star Wars costumes, arming themselves with confetti cannons, fire extinguishers and other tools of the Blackout trade."
"When several male members begin dancing and cavorting across the black-light-illuminated stage, the audience--teens and twentysomethings uniformly decked out in neon tank tops, surfer shorts and flip-flops--explodes in appreciation, uncorking the kinds of shrieks and shouts typically reserved for rock stars, not bloggers and interns."
"Portnoy is a man who does what he wants, when he wants, and his haters-gonna-hate attitude, tireless work ethic and uncanny understanding of the elusive 18- to 35-year-old male demographic have built Barstool Sports from a weekly sports-betting-theme print publication distributed for free at Boston transit stops to a digital multimedia juggernaut: a wide-ranging, unabashedly profane men's lifestyle blog bolstered by flourishing live events and merchandise businesses."
"A much-imitated, never-duplicated resource for the latest on sports, entertainment and women--the tent poles of the dude zeitgeist--the site is must-reading for a growing legion of high-profile male athletes and sports-media personalities, many of whom have appeared on the Barstool-produced online video series ""The Bro Show"" and podcast ""KFC Radio,"" hosted by blogger Kevin Clancy, who heads Barstool's New York City efforts."
"Feminist groups have rallied against the site, which boasts daily features such as ""Guess That Ass"" and ""Local Smokeshow of the Day,"" a spotlight of female college students from around the country."
Portnoy has appeared on the TV newsmagazine Inside Edition to defend charges that the Blackout parties promote binge drinking and misogyny.
"Portnoy's decision to post a nude photo of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's 20-month-old son also earned him a visit from Massachusetts state police, got him banned from Boston sports radio station WEEI and even led to an on-air scolding from Howard Stern."
"He is fighting against everyone who says you have to play by the same cookie-cutter rules, and he won't stop until he proves he's right."
"When students at Boston's Northeastern University launched the grassroots organization Knockout Barstool to protest what they call the site's ""cycle of misogyny and rape culture,"" the Stoolies rushed to Portnoy's defense across all corners of the social media landscape."
"Portnoy, himself, is the target of many insults, which run the gamut from blog syntax issues to his physique--and those are some of the milder remarks."
"I know there are people who don't want to go on the site because there are girls in thongs and their asses are everywhere, but who cares?"
"The interior suggests the unholy union of a fraternity house and a crime scene: Beer advertisements featuring half-naked women adorn the walls, towers of junk wobble in every corner, and the carpet is soiled with a panoply of dark dribbles and stains."
"The impish Portnoy holds court from an attic office above the fray, dressed in a ""Bro Surf"" T-shirt and blue jeans."
"Those guys don't need anything nice down there, and I certainly don't."
Portnoy and his growing blogger team publish between 70 and 80 posts each weekday--everything from sports commentary to stream-of-consciousness tirades to bikini shots to coed slide shows ripped from Facebook--no finesse necessary.
"A born sloganeer, he has devised a lexicon of Barstool signatures, including ""smokeshows"" (i.e, beautiful women), ""hardo"" (an arrogant or obnoxious male) and, most famously, ""Viva La Stool,"" the rallying cry that has spawned countless homemade signs hoisted at sporting events, live news broadcasts and even the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton."

"Some have questioned the efficacy of the boycott, given that in part, this situation stemmed from women speaking out about harassment and not being silent."

"For voicing her fears, she says, she has been the victim of a smear campaign within the party and branded “transphobic”."
"Hers is the latest skirmish in a war on the left about the rights of transgender people, who identify as a gender that is different from the sex of their birth."
"Helen Steel, says she was harassed after defending the right of two women to distribute leaflets about the reforms at a book fair."
The broader debate about transgender rights has become so acrimonious that A Woman’s Place kept the location of its recent meeting secret.
"Currently, those wishing to change their legal gender must have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the distress arising from the sense that their true gender does not match their sex at birth, and have lived according to their chosen gender for two years."
The government would scrap those requirements and have applicants “self-declare” their gender identity instead.
"It also wants to revise the Equality Act, which allows organisations running gender-sensitive services—from hospital wards to prisons—to discriminate on the basis of sex, as long as it is “a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”."
"It is legal to turn away a transgender woman from a domestic-violence shelter, for instance, if her presence would frighten others."
Ms Ruzylo worries that abusive men would find it easier to enter women-only spaces if they could change gender by declaration alone.
"Ms Thompson, a transgender woman who was convicted of theft, failure to surrender to court and breach of a suspended sentence, told friends she would kill herself if she was sent to a male prison."
"Ms Ruzylo, a former prison officer, believes that anyone born male should not be imprisoned in a women’s jail."
Both girls and boys are less constrained by their sex than ever before.
"Women can not only vote and own property, but stand for election and run companies."
Men can care for children—and for their appearance.
"Both sexes are free to love, and in many countries marry, whomever they wish."
"Some feminists reject the claim that trans women (people registered male at birth who have made the transition to a female identity) are indeed women, rather than men who eschew stereotypically male behaviour."
Just because you lop off your dick” does not make you a woman.
"Gender reassignment is a momentous choice, since it causes irreversible physical changes and, if surgery is done to reshape the genitalia, perhaps also sterility."
"For gender-dysphoric children the clock is ticking, since puberty moulds bodies in ways no drugs or scalpel can undo."
Most gender-dysphoric children will probably not become transgender adults.
"Specialists who start by trying to help gender-dysphoric children settle in their birth identities, rather than making a speedy switch, risk being labelled transphobes and forced out of their jobs."
"It is bad enough that doctors, parents and gender-dysphoric children must make high-stakes choices against time without good evidence about what will happen."
The child’s interests depend not on the feelings of transgender activists—nor those of feminists—but on facts that still need to be established.
"A BEAUTIFUL man with high cheekbones, fluttering eyelashes and a galaxy of silver glitter in his hair strides into the room."
He is wearing a wedding dress and dirty trainers.
Convention-defying statements of gender identity are moving from stage and dance floor to everyday life.
"The word “gender” is used by prudes to avoid saying “sex”, and restricted by purists (and, until recently, The Economist’s style guide) to speaking about grammar."
In the 1970s feminists described the restricted behaviour regarded as proper to men and women as “gender roles”.
"In recent years “gender identity” has come to mean how people feel or present themselves, as distinct from biological sex or sexual orientation."
Growing numbers of young people describe themselves as “non-binary”.
"Some say gender is a spectrum, or that they have no gender at all."
"Facebook offers users a list of over 70 gender identities, from “agender” to “two-spirit”, as well as the option to write in their own."
New and old notions of gender identity collide most starkly in transgender people: those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificates.
"Though clinics that treat gender dysphoria—distress caused by a mismatch between felt and perceived gender identity—report a soaring caseload, transgender people are still rare."
"Moreover, young people say that gender matters less than it used to, which sits oddly with the spreading belief that gender dysphoria can be severe enough to justify the upheaval and risks of transitioning."
"Transgender identities raise more general questions, and not only for those cultural conservatives who regard them as transgressing the natural, perhaps God-given, order."
"There is a tension between believing that it is possible to feel, act or look so much “like a woman” that you should be acknowledged as one, and believing, as feminists do, that a woman can act in any way she wishes without casting doubt on her womanhood."
"A war of words has broken out between some transgender activists and women they call TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) about who should be let into women-only spaces, from domestic-violence refuges to women’s literary and sports competitions."
What to do with children who say they have been classified as the wrong sex?
"As well as 22 pairs of matched chromosomes, female humans have two X chromosomes."
"Males have one X and a smaller Y. From this follow hormonal differences that shape female and male bodies, with most of the work done in the womb and during puberty."
Human females and males differ little in regard to most abilities and behaviour.
"Most suffer only a minor genital anomaly, but doctors will struggle to classify a few as male or female."
"Some XX people produce unusually high levels of androgens (male hormones) in the womb, and some XY ones do not respond to androgens in the usual way."
In 2013 the UN special rapporteur on torture condemned gender-normalisation surgery for children.
"Eric Vilain, a medical geneticist in Washington, DC, is leading a longitudinal study on the treatment of intersex children."
"Intersex people are unusually likely to switch gender identity at some point, perhaps because those identities are less stable or they were misclassified in childhood."
"Asked why she transitioned from the male identity on her birth certificate, she searches for words: “my own innate sense of self…I feel more comfortable; this is who I am”."
"It is harder to explain transgender identities to “cisgender” people (“cis” is the Latin prefix for “on this side of”) than to convince heterosexual people of the reality of homosexual desire, she says."
Many trans people do only “top” surgery—breast reduction or enlargement.
"Some of the most helpful surgeries for trans people are chest and facial because that is what people see,” says Colt Keo-Meier, a psychologist (and trans man)."
"Ms Willoughby endorsed workplaces requiring women to wear makeup, and said unshaven legs on women were “dirty”."
"“‘Feeling like’ a woman seems to imply feeling like wearing mascara, heels, hair extensions and stockings,” wrote Lionel Shriver, a novelist (who has written for this newspaper), last year in an essay titled “Gender—Good for Nothing” in Prospect, a British magazine."
"“The version of femininity offered up by Caitlyn Jenner is foreign to me—exaggeratedly coiffed, buffed and corseted”."
"Simone de Beauvoir’s famous remark that “a woman is not born, but made” was intended as a criticism of the arduous feminine ideal that deformed women’s lives, not as a promise that attaining that ideal conferred womanhood."
"More than a hundred academics called for its retraction, saying that it caused “harm” to trans people, for example by “dead-naming” a trans woman, that is, referring to her by her former male name."
Attempts to make language more inclusive of trans people mean that in some quarters the very words “man” and “woman” are falling out of use.
"Some sexual-health clinics now talk about “people with prostates”, “people with vaginas” and so on."
"An article in the Tab, a student magazine, about stress and the menstrual cycle avoided the words “female” and “women”, noting that over a third of “students with uteruses” at Cambridge had missed periods."
"Rows in America over which lavatories trans people should use, and whether trans women should be allowed into women-only events, have aligned some feminists with the conservatives they normally oppose in the culture wars."
"A crucial concept for those who work with trans people, says Ms Castro, is “gender-identity threat”—an attack on a trans person’s identity."
"Trans people may engage in risky sex to shore up their sense of femaleness, she says, in response to remarks or situations that threaten that sense, for example being treated in anti-HIV programmes designed for gay men—or excluded from women-only spaces."
"Cutting HIV transmission requires “gender affirmation”—reinforcing their identities in constructive ways, for example with support groups or counselling."
Parents were more bothered by “sissy” sons than “tomboy” daughters.
"And men who dressed and acted like women faced mockery, more so than the other way round."
"Some girls seem unable to find a place for themselves in a sea of sparkly pink princess dresses, and then, after puberty, in a hypersexualised pop culture."
"His starting point had been to try to help gender-dysphoric children become more comfortable with their biological sex, and to wait and see if they changed their minds."
This is puzzling: gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation.
Most gay people never doubt their gender identities.
"Plenty of trans people are homosexual; Professor Green estimates that a third of the post-surgery trans women he saw between 1995 and 2007 while working at Charing Cross Hospital in London, which had the world’s largest transgender treatment programme at the time, were attracted to women."
"The penalty for male homosexuality in Iran is death, for example, but the ayatollahs believe that a person can be “trapped” in the wrong body."
Gay Iranian men are pressed to accept cross-sex hormones and gender-reassignment surgery.
"Gender-mending Most people are comfortable with their gender identities, perhaps without having any strong sense of being male or female."
Ms Shriver writes: “I have no idea what it ‘feels like’ to be a woman—and I am one”.
"As traditional and legal constraints on men’s and women’s behaviour loosen, that group may grow and, with luck, the number of children who feel stifled by their gender roles will fall."
"But the last line reads: “Please note that the Position requires filling in the responsibilities of a receptionist, so female candidates are preferred”."
"Gender discrimination in job interviews and the workplace may be a very long way from eradicated, but rarely is it so overtly and publicly stated."
Neanderthalic behaviour such as calling a woman “honey” or “baby” is as out of fashion as cave paintings.
"There’s mounting evidence that gender-propelled language is still common in many places of employment but there’s mounting evidence, anecdotal and scientific, that gender-propelled language and attitudes are still common in many places of employment."
"No one, male or female, wants to be called a prima donna, drama queen, mean girl, Debbie Downer, or Negative Nancy, despite the appeal of alliteration."
"Communal language is mainly applied to women, and it invokes stereotypical female traits like being supportive, showing warmth, and helping the team Other terms and expressions aren’t specifically gendered, but they play into gender stereotypes that, zombie-like, just won’t die."
"Agentic language is mainly applied to men and is more about getting the job done, taking charge, and being independent."
"Male-centric lingo derived from sports, war, and machinery (like the insufferable cliché “drill down”) also reinforce the idea that the workplace is (or should be) a man cave with water coolers."
"Guy is a prime example of the tricky, illogical evolution of language and how it reflects gender."
"The plural form guys is often used to mean men and women, though the singular form is almost always male."
"Today’s gendered language, though far from harmless, is a quantum leap from some formerly common ways of describing women."
"Words such as hostess, stewardess, and waitress are still around, though passé, but they have dozens of sister words that sound bonkers today."
"A woman who wrote a book was once called an authoress, a term first found in the 1400s."
"In the 1800s, a female assassin could be called an assassinatress."
Imagine today referring to a ‘lady-executive’ or ‘lady-soldier’: you’d have to be a ‘gentleman-idiot’ A similar trend put lady at the front of words.
"An insulting, sexist sentence by DH Lawrence in 1929 uses two such terms: “You only look so distinguished and superior, when really you are slightly inferior, like a shop-lady or a lady-secretary”."
Imagine today referring to a lady-executive or lady-soldier: you’d have to be a gentleman-idiot.
"Sexism and harassment have become normalised and accepted, from schoolgirls facing regular harassment in their uniform to women in the workplace being marginalised and discriminated against, to female politicians facing open sexism in the House of Commons."
"Against the backdrop of the media’s constant portrayal of women as disposable sex objects, we are facing an epidemic of sexual violence, with over two women per week killed by a current or former partners, 400,000 women sexually assaulted and over 85,000 raped every year."
Nearly nine in 10 women believe their gender is a barrier to progressing their careers.
"The survey found 17 per cent of women believed they had been passed over for promotion solely because of their gender, with more than one-third saying it was unfairly assumed that their work was less taxing than men’s."
"Although I've been a senior figure in client meetings, when all other attendees are men it's regularly expected that I'm the one to take notes and distribute drinks."
"Every time I go to a meeting with the man in my department, he is greeted first, his hand is shaken first, and the conversation is directed towards him."
Being told I'm a 'good girl' when offering ideas to senior management.
When she went to speak with him about it his response was: 'Is it your time of the month?
Nothing personal but we'd prefer a man.
Women's ideas are often ignored – or claimed by men as their own.
"A female friend of mine in an office meeting proposed a logical, simple solution to a recurring issue."
Blank stares from the group and a 'We've never done it that way' from the senior (female) manager.
During my interview for my current position I was asked if I planned on having any more children and what my childcare arrangements are.
"The senior partner who owned the company told me they wouldn't hire me because I would probably get pregnant and go on maternity leave, and that if I repeated what he'd said he'd deny it""."
I was told on my first day back [from maternity leave]: 'You'll never be the same for us now you have baby brain.
"While I was nursing it will be difficult for me to focus on my job, so he was being generous by giving me less responsibility, and downgrading my position."
Women are more likely to be judged on appearance.
"That stereotype leads to the expectation that women will be happy to do the ""office housework,"" or low-value tasks like taking notes in meetings and mentoring junior colleagues."
Women are more likely than men to do these chores but are less likely to benefit from them.
"The issue of office housework landing on women often flies under the radar or is dismissed as insignificant, but it can be costly for a woman's career."
"Women are often expected to answer the phone, set up meetings, and fill out paperwork."
"In her Wall Street Journal article, ""Sticking Women with the Office Housework,"" Williams sites a Latina science professor who is regularly asked to play the role of mother hen and take care of various secretarial tasks."
Women are often expected to take notes in a meeting.
"Women are often asked to fetch coffee, soda, or other beverages."
"Grant and Sandberg write that women are also asked to carry out more personal tasks, such as getting coffee."
"This can be a particularly tricky situation to deal with, as women are often viewed as selfish if they say no."
Women are often expected to mentor young people and assist coworkers.
Women are often asked to head thankless committees.
"When a man says no, he faces no negative consequences; he is regarded as ""busy,"" while a woman would be considered ""selfish""."
"Women are often expected to bring cupcakes for a colleague's birthday, order food for the office, and plan parties."
"One former Tesla employee told me that women made up less than ten per cent of her working group; at one point, there were actually more men named Matt in the group than there were women."
"It’s the imbalance of pay and power that puts men in a position to harass, that gives them unchecked control over the economic lives of women and, as a result, influence over their physical lives."
"These subtler forms of discrimination, familiar to almost any woman who has held a job, can in fact be especially insidious, since they are easier for companies, and even victims, to dismiss."
"“Men who demean, degrade or disrespect women have been able to operate with such impunity—not just in Hollywood, but in tech, venture capital, and other spaces where their influence and investment can make or break a career,” Melinda Gates, the co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, told me."
Studies estimate that women make up only a quarter of employees and eleven per cent of executives in the industry.
Girls are better than guys.
Boys only bring problems.
"Several female engineers spoke about equal pay, and pressed the company to disclose compensation numbers for male and female workers."
"“He didn’t say, ‘Harassment is wrong, discrimination is wrong""."
"As a father of a daughter, I do not want to be a part of an organization or create a culture that would limit her,” Jon McNeill, the president of global sales and service, said."
"In one text message, her ex-boyfriend, apparently fearing that she was seeing someone else, allegedly wrote, “You prefer to social climb middle aged Muslim pigs that stand for nothing”."
"A year later, in 2015, a former Facebook employee named Chia Hong sued the company, claiming, among other things, that her boss had repeatedly admonished her for pursuing a career rather than staying home with her kids."
"An engineer who had worked at Uber, published a first-person account of her experience at the company on her Web site, describing how she had been propositioned for sex by her manager."
I don’t think there’s a woman who has worked in tech who hasn’t experienced some form of bias or sexual harassment somewhere along the way—myself included.
"In the past, women were often criticized or made to feel ashamed for speaking openly, while alleged harassers evaded serious scrutiny."
"It may be that allegations against high-profile men such as Bill Cosby, Bill O’Reilly, and Roger Ailes, as well as distress about President Trump’s attitude toward women (Trump has also been accused of multiple sexual assaults), has created a more receptive climate for accusations of harassment and assault."
"She told me that when she entered the industry, in the late nineteen-nineties, women were vastly outnumbered by men, but the atmosphere was not as aggressive or money-obsessed as it is today."
"She described many of the early investors and entrepreneurs as “dorks,” united by the fact that they “were all interested in technology”."
"“They happened to all be white guys who had graduated from the same handful of élite colleges,” she said."
"This created a model of hiring and investing that some refer to as the “Gates, Bezos, Andreessen, or Google model,” which Melinda Gates recently characterized as, “white male nerds who’ve dropped out of Harvard or Stanford”."
"“Now you had the frat boys coming in, and that changed the culture,” Pao said."
“Adding a few women to the mix is not going to fix this”.
"“Sit tight, chief—I’ll take you out where the big swords are”."
"In fact, the depiction of Kleiner Perkins’s workplace—including the subtly sexist and racist jokes, the negative way that ambitious women were portrayed, the practice of steering female employees toward more administrative roles and male colleagues toward high-profile, profit-driven work—would have been familiar to many professional women."
Other women in the industry felt the same way.
"On the Web site Recode, Susan Decker, the former president of Yahoo, wrote that she pulled her daughters out of school to witness the closing arguments, which she hoped would be a “watershed moment” for women in technology."
"In Fortune, Anita Hill wrote, “Hearing the ruminations on Ellen Pao’s failed gender discrimination suit against her former employer ."
"Other women in the industry wrote to Pao, to thank her and to share their stories."
"During the trial, two women filed gender-bias suits of their own, against Facebook and Twitter."
"Pao, who was the interim C.E.O. of Reddit at the time of the trial, was subjected to criticism and harassment online, in part because of choices that were unpopular with some Reddit users, including her decision to ban revenge porn."
“And that’s how you silence women and keep them from talking about their wages”.
"It is not a coincidence that the earliest gender-discrimination cases, as well as many of the newer cases against tech companies, were brought by women of color."
"The problem of racial disparity is often inextricably tied to gender disparity, and minority women may be doubly targeted, with both racism and sexism."
"“So if you believe that you’re a meritocracy, and that your meritocracy results in you being disproportionately and overwhelmingly white and Asian male, then you believe that any tinkering with how you recruit, assign, promote, and retain people is somehow, quote-unquote, lowering the bar”."
"In 2014, Google, after years of public pressure to release its diversity data, finally disclosed the gender and racial makeup of its workforce."
"In technical roles, women accounted for just seventeen per cent of the company’s employees."
"Throughout my career at Google, there was the standard thing: ‘I know you want to work on this thing, but we’re going to let a white dude work on it."
"She said that Schmidt asked her to leave Frank a message describing his technical issue, which she was more than qualified to address."
"Schmidt then suggested she put a sign on the door explaining her role, even though other offices didn’t have such signs."
She added that senior Google employees often confused her with the sole other black woman in a technical job on her team.
Her impression was that many of her colleagues couldn’t “distinguish two completely different black women from each other”.
Women were being paid less than their male counterparts at five of the six job levels the database covered.
"Earlier this year, the Department of Labor conducted an initial audit of Google’s pay practices, and found, according to court testimony in April, “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” showing, one official has said, six to seven standard deviations between pay for men and women in nearly every job category."
"In September, three women brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all female Google employees, accusing the company of “segregating” women into lower-paying jobs and of paying them less than their male counterparts for “substantially similar work”."
"Women are tired of not being taken seriously, and attending ridiculous seminars on how women can get ahead."
"It’s been a long time of talking about skill-building for women, but men aren’t making room, and they’re treating women in a sexualized way and not paying them fairly."
"Almost half the women who go into technology eventually leave the field, more than double the percentage of men who depart."
"The turnover of women and minorities, according to a 2017 study on “tech leavers,” costs Silicon Valley more than sixteen billion dollars each year."
"The same study showed that, in almost sixty per cent of cases, female employees who had been sexually harassed said that the harassment contributed to their decision to change professions."
"The primary differences between the experiences of female employees who left and those who remained, according to another study, had to do with negative perceptions of the workplace environment, unfairness, and lack of opportunity."
She grew up with parents who convinced her she could do anything she put her mind to.
Minshew told me that for years she scoffed at the idea that she was at a professional disadvantage as a woman.
“I entered the workforce and was very quickly hit with the reality that women are often still perceived differently from men”.
"As a very young female analyst I was there to get the coffee, and the young men were assumed to be the math geniuses or the tech whizzes."
"In 2011, she co-founded the Muse, which was initially aimed at early-career women looking for advice on everything from asking for raises to dealing with difficult bosses."
"The conventional wisdom about such questions was based on what had worked for men, Minshew felt, and many of the rules that applied to men were not the same as those that applied to women."
"Soon Minshew and her co-founders began to raise money for the company, something that many of their male classmates who were entrepreneurs seemed to be doing with relative ease."
"“That was a very defining moment for me, in terms of encounters with sexism and gender bias in tech,” she said."
"“It really existed on a spectrum, from overt sexual passes and comments to very dismissive or patronizing attitudes toward me because of my gender”."
Minshew and the investor ordered drinks and talked about her business plan.
She found herself wedged between the end of a sofa and the man’s body as he leaned into her.
"Aileen Lee, a founder of the venture-capital firm Cowboy Ventures, told me that she’d witnessed behavior that ranged from biased to illegal, and had faced racism, sexism, and harassment."
"“Like most women, I’ve experienced things across the spectrum,” she said."
“I’ve had a general partner at another firm—who had earlier in the day talked to me about how much I’d like his wife and how she was a smart working woman and how we should all have dinner together with their kids—call me at three in the morning while we were on a business trip and ask if he could come to my room”.
Minshew told me that the reaction from friends in the industry made her feel that it was pointless to speak up about the incident.
"“When a female entrepreneur told several male entrepreneurs the next day, the general attitude was, ‘Well, what do you expect?"
You’re a pretty girl and of course these guys are all going to try to get in your pants.
"She also realized that very few investors had dealt with female founders before, and that some struggled with how to comport themselves."
Male investors often couldn’t conceive of a business that catered to women who worked full-time.
They would ask multiple times whether her customer base would disappear once women entered their thirties and started having children.
"“they thought it was so cute that I was trying to play with the boys, like I was a circus animal”."
"Minshew told me that as soon as the company established itself, the predatory behavior from male investors stopped."
"In some cases, sexual harassment allegations are a sign of even more serious violations at a company."
"Ottinger, who is slight and boyish and speaks in a near-mumble, now runs his own practice out of San Francisco, and sometimes finds himself representing Silicon Valley employees."
"The atmosphere of the office was overly sexualized: male executives made lewd comments to female employees, and employees, including managers and their subordinates, were having sex in parked cars and in bathroom stalls."
"One manager allegedly joked about dipping “his pen in the company inkwell,” according to court documents."
"He also allegedly asked one of his female subordinates to fetch him K-Y Jelly, and talked to another about anal sex."
"Female colleagues told one another to “watch out,” and not to get “cornered” by Fanlo."
"“I never hit on anyone there, ever,” he said."
"Nonetheless, several former employees of SoFi told me that he seemed to be “dating” several women in the office at various points."
"He liked to host wine-tasting parties at his house, and a former employee who attended one said that Cagney spent much of the evening boasting about his sexual conquests and visits to strip clubs."
Aurora and Honeywell developed their theory after they noticed a pattern in the tech world that mirrored the Al Capone case: predatory sexual behavior was often accompanied by other infractions.
"“People who engage in sexual harassment or assault are also likely to steal, plagiarize, embezzle, engage in overt racism, or otherwise harm their business” ."
"All of these behaviors are the actions of someone who feels entitled to other people’s property—regardless of whether it’s someone else’s ideas, work, money, or body."
"Mark Hurd, a former C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard, was accused of sexual harassment but resigned for lying on expense reports."
Iit’s no coincidence that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Harvey Weinstein’s charity transactions even as he is being investigated on rape charges.
"UK employers are “living in the dark ages” and have worrying attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood, new research has revealed."
"During the recruitment process, a woman should have to disclose whether or not she is pregnant."
It is acceptable to ask women about their plans to have children before deciding whether to give them a job.
Almost half were under the mistaken impression asking whether women have young children was acceptable.
Women should work for an organisation for at least a year before deciding to have children.
Women who have had more than one pregnancy while in the same job can be a “burden” to their team.
At least one pregnant woman in their workplace “take advantage” of their pregnancy.
Women who become pregnant and new mothers in work are “generally less interested in career progression” when compared to other employees in their company.
Negative attitudes towards new mothers also affected fathers.
Few men take parental leave when they see the harsh treatment women receive when they take time off to care for a baby.
"“Maternity discrimination is a key factor in the gender pay gap and has a long-term impact on women’s employment prospects,”"
"“It is a depressing reality that, when it comes the rights of pregnant woman and new mothers in the workplace, we are still living in the dark ages""."
"""It is against the law not to appoint a woman because she is pregnant or might become pregnant""."
“Yet we also know women routinely get asked questions about family planning in interviews”.
Women are consistently told that it is their choice to earn less money and be less likely to be promoted to a top job than men.
"“That requires universal childcare, more flexible working, and a shared parental leave system that would split the joys and responsibilities of parenthood between both parents and ensure companies stopped seeing having children as something that affects only women”."
Job interviews were particularly “ripe territory” for maternity discrimination.
"“Unlike sex or race, however, there is no specific coverage for harassment related to pregnancy or maternity”."
"Women are more likely to be subjected to double disadvantage based on sex and age, or race."
"“Women who are of the age where they might be looking to start a family or at least perceived as such, are more likely to be subjected to this particular form of ill-treatment”"
"What is the point of feminism, if not to ensure women are treated the same as men?"
And how can any woman expect equality unless she’s willing to be as self-sufficient and independent as any man?
The youngster was at the centre of a legal battle over his treatment that touched hearts around the world.
There’s nothing wrong in principle with women retiring at the same age as men.
"These older women are disadvantaged both by their present low status, and by the after-effects of a lifetime of overt and covert discrimination."
"If she was married, the unpaid labour she contributed in the home will have meant more money in her husband’s pocket, not hers."
Female domestic labour and care work have benefited the economy and come at the expense of older women’s own freedom and emotional well-being.
Women in their sixties and older are essentially being discriminated against for having been discriminated against in the first place.
"It’s not about sisters but mothers and grandmothers – women whom younger feminists might love, but don’t necessarily want to be."
There’s a degree to which younger women gain reassurance from deciding older women are at least partly responsible for the predicament they find themselves in.
I used to look at women such as my own mother and grandmother and think “I won’t end up like you”.
"Feminism was made for women like me, who didn’t identify with self-sacrifice and servitude (which older women, I would tell myself, quite obviously did)."
"It took a long time for me to realise, first, that self-sacrifice and dependency are necessary parts of human existence and second, that no woman is born with a dishcloth in one hand and a sick bucket in the other."
That older women have made compromises on behalf of others throughout their lives isn’t testament to their femininity; it’s testament to their humanity.
"""It is a simple fact that gender fluidity is on the rise” declares the Guardian’s Matthew D’Ancona, as though it isn’t the case that women have, since time immemorial, endured discrimination due to assumptions made about their inner lives on the basis of their sex."
"There has, surely, never been a time when a woman’s sense of self wasn’t at odds with dominant beliefs about what a woman is."
It should be incumbent on younger feminists to stand shoulder to shoulder with those being asked to pay the price for a lifetime of exploitation.
"The alternative is reaching an age when we, women, shall be written off as having been complicit in our own oppression."
Easier by far to hate and reject a mother outright than to see beyond her to the forces acting upon her.
"No woman asks to be born at the wrong time, but each and every woman is."
"It’s only through acting collectively, on behalf of all generations, that we can end the cycle of women being treated as a valuable but ultimately disposable resource."
"“Oh, he’s a good writer, but he tends to get over emotional about things and let that get in the way of his writing""."
"""He’s kind of a girl like that”."
"I wasn’t going to consider hiring any females, but I’m glad I did."
"You should be proud, I had thousands of applications but yours stuck out to me, and made me decide to give hiring a girl a try."
Deeply rooted gender bias can undermine relationships.
Men can be subject to that bias just as easily as women.
"Now you would think that in a committed relationship with two otherwise intelligent and conscious human beings it would rarely, if ever, rear its ugly head."
"Well, I'm here to report that it most certainly can, and just how potentially destructive it can be."
"s couples and relationships go, my partner and I like to think of ourselves as evolved, conscious and willing to authentically and vulnerably communicate no matter what the topic or how uncomfortable it may be."
"On top of all that, I just finished serving as the Program Director for the recent Conscious Men Summit featuring John Gray, Arjuna Ardagh and co-sponsored by the ManKind Project USA."
"The central theme of this four-day event (featuring some of the top speakers, authors and thought leaders in the conscious men movement) was how to help men overcome cultural stereotyping and allow themselves to fully express and feel everything without a sense of self-diminishment or shame."
This includes helping men to avoid shutting down and tough it out when confronted with emotions that are difficult or painful.
Not an easy task when male expression of vulnerability is viewed as a weakness within our culture rather than the strength it truly is.
The Irony is Killing Me So it is with the height of all irony that just last week I find myself being subjected to a profound and deeply embedded gender bias.
"From my female partner, the love of my life, no less."
Sometime last weekend (the week prior to my writing this) I expressed to my partner some anxiety I was feeling about uncertainty now that my gig as Conscious Men Summit Program Director was coming to an end.
I honestly don't even remember what I said or when I said it but I certainly was feeling the anxiety and she was picking it up.
My partner and I typically schedule our weekly lovemaking sessions on Sunday mornings so we can enjoy giving to each other without interruption or distraction.
What she said actually made a lot of sense.
She went on to express her concern that she might not be able to climax for me and felt quite a bit of performance anxiety over that possibility.
"So, I shared with her what I coach others to say: ""Sweetie, I'm not concerned about whether you climax or not, only that you enjoy my giving to you."""
"She responded: ""Of course, but I don't want to disappoint you""."
Her concerns were quite unfounded as she came explosively many times.
"Funny thing though, I felt deep down that there was more to this because our usual heightened sensual energy still felt a bit off I just couldn't put my finger on it."
"Only this time, what she said, frankly left me dumbstruck."
She went on to share that her lack of initial desire last time surprised and bothered her as well.
It wasn't until she left to return to her own home that she really started to consider the reasons.
It eventually became crystal clear to her that my exhibiting vulnerability and anxiety about my interim financial situation was the source of the turn-off.
"In her words, it made me look weak in her eyes and she, like many women, find strong men, those who exhibit certainty in all things to be more sexually attractive."
"Even though she does not depend upon me financially, just knowing that at this time my ability in this arena is somewhat limited, along with my exhibited concern, caused her to feel less sexual attraction."
Her very reasons for being turned off are the very definition of the expected gender-bias imprinting for males still very much alive within our 21st century culture.
"Even though most women today no longer need to depend upon a man to survive, the old paradigm of the strong, dependable, emotionally stoic male provider as the ideal mate still impacts even some of the most conscious of women."
The ntithesis came from the mouth of the woman I absolutely respect and adore.
"When she shared this with me in her very matter of fact way I felt stricken, diminished and frankly, angry."
For a full minute I just sat there looking into her eyes not saying a word or showing any expression at all.
My very first impulse was to completely shut-down and disconnect from her.
"If she wanted a man who just stuffs his feelings and shows only strength, I can give her that."
I'm the guy that teaches other guys how NOT to do this.
"She admitted she was totally taken by surprise that those feelings emerged within her despite knowing better, despite being so conscious and aware."
"Clearly, men have every much as right to express authentic vulnerability as women."
"In fact, it could be argued that the very survival of our species will depend to some significant degree that we can give men the safe space needed to do so."
"As I sit here watching my son and daughter playing together, my heart melts."
My son is cuddling up to my daughter while she is reading a book; she puts her arm around him.
"As I sit and watch them smile and laugh together, I think, ""I hope they always stay this close, this loving and this content""."
"I also think back to my time growing up with my brother, wishing we were this close."
I always loved my brother and still do.
"I went to an all girls school, was never permitted to go on sleepovers, and certainly battled it out with my very-protective father when it came to school dances, prom and other social outings with friends."
"Don't get me wrong, my parents loved us both equally, passionately and raised us both to pursue higher education, academics and professional careers."
"My mother was a rock, my confidante, an incredibly selfless mom and she still is."
My dad always made sure we had everything we needed and pushed both of us equally to be ambitious in our lives and supported us both financially.
"At times, however, I felt being female meant earlier curfews, restrictions on social outings and certainly more arguments with my father on why my brother was able to do things I couldn't."
"No one said, ""because he's a boy""."
"Looking back, while may dad may have been looking out for my best interests, I don't think he realized the impact his parenting would have on our sibling relationship."
In my experience I think the gender bias played a role in creating tension in my relationship with my brother.
Gender bias in this way by parents can be difficult for children especially if they don't understand why.
"""In our culture, the bias is typically in favour of the son, rather than the daughter,"" said Shah."
"""Naturally, upon seeing the bias, daughters are most likely to become jealous or even resentful toward their brothers."""
"When I became a parent, I promised myself I wouldn't have these 'double standards' in my home, especially for fear of how this would play out between my daughter and son as they got older."
"While women may face double standards and gender bias in their workplaces and in society, I think teaching our children how to handle it should begin in the home."
"I see my daughter who cherishes her brother everyday and I pray that as they age they always have a strong, mutually supportive bond."
I also hope she and my son are driven by their ambition not their gender in all that they do.
"""Generally, gender roles are formed through nurture (socialization, parenting, education),"" said Shah."
"""Parents (not just South Asians) distribute household tasks based on gender such as washing dishes to daughters and mowing the lawn to sons."
"Parents typically make these roles even clearer by saying ""You're a girl, that's why you need to know how to cook""."
"She adds that although parents sometimes do realize that they are encouraging specific behaviour in daughters and other behaviours in sons, they are typically unaware that this places a barrier between the kids' relationship with each other."
"""The parents that experienced the gender divide and understand how it affected their own sibling relationships will sometimes be more mindful of their own parenting in relation to gender bias""."
"So if you do have sibling tension or a break up, how is that conflict managed so that you don't carry that forward into your own life as a parent?"
"""The first step is acknowledging the tense feelings and being mindful that those feelings affect your relationship."
"Secondly, one must acknowledge that usually parents don't realize that they are giving preference or special advantages to sons since it's a natural part of our culture."
"As most of us understand, our country's culture is mostly a male-dominated culture."
Shah also points out sons can't be accused of perpetuating the bias just because they take advantage of the extra opportunities.
"""Similar to the concept of 'White privilege,' sons are often not even aware that they have special attention or extra privileges compared to their sisters,"" said Shah."
But we can't expect our brothers to feel sorry or apologize for being given advantages.
The best approach is to directly communicate to your brother or sister that you value the relationship and want to improve it.
"Or if that feels uncomfortable, then just simply put in more effort toward spending time together or calling""."
"At the end of the day, the sibling relationship is like any other in that it needs to be nurtured from start to finish."
As parents we should know that how we parent works in tandem and becomes the model for the relationship between children as well.
"While growing up female may have had its challenges, we can only go so long in blaming our childhood challenges for our issues as adults."
"As mothers with South Asian roots, I think it's up to us to embrace how we were raised in our rich culture and choose to move toward a positive future for our children."
What do you tell your children about the disconnection if any between you and your sibling?
A man and a woman in the same heterosexual relationship are actually in different relationships.
Happy couples have fewer gender differences.
"In unhappy relationships, there are clear differences between men and women in emotional expression."
"According to Dr. John Gottman's highly respected research, gender issues significantly exacerbate relationship problems."
"We know that it's ok for men to cry, and that housework isn't just for women."
Ongoing gender issues in the post-modern age are complex and a source of debate.
"Girls' identities are shaped primarily by their relationships, so in games they tend to care more about how the players relate to each other."
"When arguments occur, the game can end with one girl declaring: I won't be your friend anymore."
"Boys, on the other hand, tend to be defined more by achievements."
This creates men less practiced in feeling intense emotions.
Men's ability to subordinate emotions to get the job done is a handicap in long-term relationships.
Gender Issues: His and Her Relatinoships I hate to make generalizations because they just don't hold true in all cases.
"But more often than not, gender differences all boil down to one thing: Men are less able to handle intense emotions."
Dr. Gottman found by observing married couples over many years that this fundamental difference manifests itself in various ways: 1) Men are more easily emotionally flooded.
Men take longer to recover from emotional upset as well.
Women are more prone to bring up problems in the relationship.
Men and women have different grievances.
Men tend to gripe about their wives complaints and their emotional expressions.
Women are more likely to complain: she just won't talk to me about it.
Women feel they need to raise the emotional intensity to keep their partner responsive.
"When women demand more intensity than her man can comfortably offer, he withdraws."
Women are more likely to bring up the past.
This usually occurs when she is engulfed in emotion.
"When she brings up the past, she is more prone to using sarcasm and criticism than her man."
Women do more housework than men.
"Even in couples that are not stereo-typically gender divided, women still do more housework."
"When men do housework, it is considered a nice favor, something to be actively appreciated."
For women there is a big connection between housework and sex.
"Basic formula: The more housework a man does, the more sex he has."
This has great ramifications for you men.
What do to about it: For men: Accept her feelings and allow her to express herself without getting defensive (for info on how to be less defensive click here ).
For women: Learn how to bring things up gently.
"Remove criticism from your arsenal (to break the habit of criticism, click here )."
"Complaining is okay sometimes, as long as the intention is to improve the relationship."
Give your guy space when he is flooded.
For both of you: Accept your differences without judgement!
This seems obvious but is really hard sometimes.
Work at making up: Being able to successfully repair hurts after conflict is a big predictor of relationship success.
"Appreciate each other, and cultivate fondness for each other."
Remember: Gender differences don't have to mean gender inequality.
"As long as we remain aware and own our part in the equation, our differences can create greater depth, diversity, and opportunities for spiritual growth."
"The bias facing women in the business world is very real, but these women think cannabis may be different."
Women make up a majority of the U.S. population (51 percent).
They earn almost 60 percent of undergraduate degrees and 60 percent of all master's degrees.
Women also earn 47 percent of all law degrees and 48 percent of all medical degrees.
"Yet, there are so few women at the top of corporate America."
"Among the S&P 500 companies in the financial services industry, women make up 54 percent of the labor force, but only 29 percent hold executive and senior-level positions--and only 2 percent are CEOs."
The startup space is abysmal at best for women looking to get ahead.
"Fifty-seven percent of U.S. startups report that they have no women in the C-suite, and 71 percent have no women on their boards."

"While others may see tremendous challenges and stigma in the weed business, many women see opportunity."
"Women are used to having to go above and beyond to prove our merit, says Jen Price, Founder of Potnt, a public relations and marketing agency servicing the cannabis, hemp, and ancillary spaces."
"We are determined care-givers, and cannabis has given women the opportunity to apply our professional skills and to make our mark on an emerging industry full of promise."
"Women in Green Thirty-six percent of cannabis industry executives are female, which may seem small until you realize that the national average for female executives across all industries is only 22 percent."
"For an industry still in its infancy, there is plenty of time for cannabis to lead the way in gender equality."
"I definitely see a beautiful trend in the cannabis industry with strong women rising to leadership positions more so than in any other emerging industry, says Jennifer M. Sanders, Founder & CEO of CNS Equity Partners."
"Against these odds, ""women have pushed the door wide open in this space, using perseverance, intuition and the creative solutions necessary to build a billion-dollar industry from seed to success"" said Price."
Women tend to create support networks and place collaboration ahead of competition.
"Putting financial gain aside, many women have been drawn into the cannabis industry simply out of necessity."
"There's no one answer to how to be a good dad: It's an ever-changing, ever-evolving pursuit."
It's also fair to say that this particular moment is particularly thought-provoking.
"The president has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women, the head of Hollywood's most prominent film studio was arrested on charges of rape, sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, and committing a criminal sex act, and by all estimations, the MeToo movement is just getting started."
"I've always worked to make sure my sons know how to respect and value women, men, and people with different gender identities."
"As a gay man who is engaged to another man, there's not a lot of female energy in the house."
I'm really proud of my older son.
I've heard his friends say something derogatory about a woman.
"And he'll always say, 'How would you feel if someone said that about your mom?"
"Henry made Jane a Mother's Day card once where he said, 'My mother is fast, my mother is strong, my mother builds things."
He's learned that it's okay to play with dolls and fairies and other things some classmates gender.
"He wears pink to school, even after some kids have made fun of him for it, and has recently asked us to paint his room pink."
I joined a women's interest network.
So I guess I was a little more sensitive about women's issues.
I had a cavalier attitude to the casting couch: Men in power demand sex and women give it away for career advancement.
I do not think the MeToo movement has really changed my approach to being her father per se of course I have always been sensitive to these issues and I was raised myself by strong women who taught me care and respect.
I have always felt that my job as a parent was to do my best to raise a confident and independent child who knew they were unconditionally loved and cared for.
I have always been open and honest and available emotionally for her and I think we have a strong and open relationship for communication.
I would never want her to experience any of these horrible things but I hope I'm giving her the tools to manage and avoid these potential situations or at least put up a good fight.
"The first conversation we ever had was, 'Hello, I love you, welcome to the world, your mother is the most amazing person."""
I always aspired to be a feminist dad.
"But now there is now a constant flow of new stories and headlines, that, to be really reductive, constantly remind us that men can be terrible people."
It's a constant remind of my gender and of his.
How to be a good man is an interesting question anyway.
I want to raise a man who is respectful of other men and women.
"I want to teach him to be super compassionate, empathetic, and aware of others."
"Even at two, he has an innate ability to make people around him happy."
"Cheerleaders are many things, but ""silent"" and ""invisible"" don't tend to be the words we use to describe them."
"Which is why it's so bizarre to learn, thanks to a gender discrimination suit filed by former New Orleans Saints cheerleader Bailey Davis, that off-duty Saints cheerleaders are expected to all but disappear."
"In a report on the lawsuit, the New York Times outlined the extent to which women's bodies are policed and controlledâ€”even in their place of work."
"After she posted a photo of herself in a one-piece leotard on her private Instagram; the Saintsations claimed that this photo broke the team's rules that bar cheerleaders from posing in lingerie, which Davis disputes."
The New York Times summarized the rules which cheerleaders must follow: Cheerleaders must block Saints players on social media and the team dictates what outfits are appropriate on social mediaâ€”no Saints gear (which is considered a form of marketing) and no lingerie.
"The rules around their social lives are even stricter: ""Cheerleaders are told not to dine in the same restaurant as players, or speak to them in any detail."
"If a Saints cheerleader enters a restaurant and a player is already there, she must leave."
"If a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player arrives afterward, she must leave""."
"Davis' mother, Lora Davis, claims that cheerleaders are not even allowed to make small talk with players: ""[Cheerleaders have] been told that anything beyond 'hello' and 'great game' is too personal. It's considered fraternization to say anything beyond that""."
"Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It's an ancient prejudice: rather than examine men's behavior, women are supposed to make themselves less available to men, the better to â€œprotectâ€ themselves from predation."
"These rules are supposedly meant to protect the cheerleaders from sexual attention, which of course doesn't explain why none of them apply to the Saints players themselves."
"Players can follow whomever they like on social media; they're allowed to wear Saints gear in selfies; and they're not required to change their plans, shut up, or leave the premises if a cheerleader turns up."
"It's an ancient prejudice: rather than examine men's behavior, women are supposed to make themselves less available to men, the better to protect themselves from predation."
"Instead of putting the onus on men not to be sexually inappropriate with their colleagues, the team asks cheerleaders to sequester themselves in order not to be seen as temptresses."
"Davis claims she never socialized with the Saints, but the mere impression was enough to compromise her career."
"After she posted the one-piece photo to her private Instagram account she'd locked it to prevent NFL players from following her, per team rules she received a text message from Ashley Deaton, senior director of the squad: ""Very poor judgement to post a picture like that especially considering our recent conversations about the rumors going around about u""."
"The claim that Davis' gender discrimination makes is simple: It is implicitly discriminatory to put all the burden for preventing â€œfraternizationâ€ on cheerleaders, who are mostly female, and not on players, who are exclusively male."
"But the undercurrent here is just as toxic, with an employer essentially treating a female employee's body as company property."
"As commentators have noted, the one-piece that Davis wore on Instagram covers as much or more of her body than the Saints' two-piece cheerleading uniform."
"The team doesn't seem to mind monetizing their cheerleaders' sexuality on the field, then punishing it after-hours."
Employers frequently assume control of female employees' bodies in a way that doesn't apply to men.
"Even in relatively comfortable and safe office work, women are pressured to look conventionally attractive (by wearing heels, or makeup, or getting manicures, or generally being ""put together"" in a thousand ways men don't have to think about), but they're penalized for unprofessionalism if they're so attractive it ""distracts"" their coworkers."
"Even as women have made gains in the workplace, women's bodies are still seen as commodities for men to possess, exploit, and trade."
"Women are simultaneously told that flirting will increase their negotiation power and that flirting in the workplace ""will usually backfire""."
"They're accused of lacking gravitas, then called hostile and cold if they don't smile."
And it only gets worse for women of color witness the endless rules and regulations governing how professional black women can wear their hair.
"In terms of the Saintsations, who are required to present themselves in sexy outfits on the field, but be modest of it, the upshot is painfully sexist: women are meant to be looked at and wanted by others; what they want is beside the point."
The NFL continues to deal with domestic violence cases or claims of sexual assault about football players.
"If the point of all their rules is to stem the tide of sexual misconduct, the Saints could start with a zero-tolerance policy for the men on the team when it comes to their behavior around women."
"Until then, not much good can come from a social media blackout on women's selfies."
"The discussion had all of us analyzing our stances on various things, including who pays for dates, who should be the breadwinner in the relationship, and whether or not it is OK for a woman to propose marriage to her male partner."
"These may all seem like simple questions to answer, but there are variables that go along with themâ€”variables that can make people's answers differ based on who they are in a relationship with, how long the relationship has been going on, and whether or not they can see a long-term future with the person involved."
"When you go out on a date, who pays the man or the woman?"
"In casual dating, I generally expect that if I am going out with a man, he is going to pay for the date."
How he handles the check situation will likely play a big role in determining whether or not I will go out with him again.
"If he attempts to avoid looking at the check, waits to see if I will grab it first or even suggests that we split, he gets the side eye from me."
"If you ask me to go out with you, I am assuming that you are paying, or else why ask?"
"There are folks who say the exception to this rule is if the woman asks for the date, and on that I can agree so I don't ask men out on dates, because I don't want to be in the position of paying in a casual dating situation."
I feel differently if I am in a long-term situation with someone.
"In those types of scenarios, I am more inclined to offer to split the bill or just pay the bill outright sometimes because we have a bigger involvement than just casually seeing each other."
"I am more invested in the relationship, and therefore more invested in the person, so splitting the check or taking turns paying makes more sense to meâ€”especially in cases where I make more money than my partner."
Advertisement Is it acceptable for a woman to be the breadwinner in the relationship?
"Men are traditionally seen as being providers and therefore the breadwinners in a relationship, but what happens when that is not the case?"
Are we comfortable with the idea of a woman making the most money?
Can relationships work when a woman is the provider?
"I have had this scenario happen more than once in my adult life, and it was always uncomfortable, for a number of reasons."
"Men have a sense of pride that is unrivaled by anything else, really."
Their egos can often drive them toward behavior that is harmful and even destructive.
I found this to be the case in a previous relationship in which I made more money.
Not being able to afford the things that I liked made him feel some type of way.
Having his girl pay for things that he felt he should have been paying for made him feel some type of way.
My not necessarily needing him for financial or material things made him feel some type of way.
The other side of the game is complacency.
"There are some men who are already generally unmotivated, and having a woman who has her own money and can afford to do things not just for herself but for them as a couple can lead to him never wanting more for himself."
"Why should he, when she can do everything anyway?"
"What this has shown me is that in long-term situations, I need a man who is evenly yoked with me."
It just creates less complications and less confusion.
Is it OK for a woman to propose?
The idea that only a man should propose marriage is heavily steeped in patriarchy and the romantic ideals we have been sold by the capitalist spending program known as the wedding industry.
"If a woman loves her man and wants to ask him to marry her, why shouldn't she be able to?"
It doesn't take anything away from him if she does.
"Advertisement The worst he can do is say no, and it's the same risk a man takes in asking a woman."
"Of the three topics we discussed, this is the one I couldn't really wrap my head around, because I didn't understand what the big deal was."
Why can't a woman propose?
"We all have our different stances on them, and for the most part our minds won't be changed but it is an interesting and ongoing discussion that obviously needs to take place."
We will be discussing gender roles in dating and relationships when The Root After Dark Twitter chat returns on Tuesday at 11 p.
Achieving gender equality is as much a matter of changing and expanding roles for men as advancing women in the workplace.
"Though a majority of Americans support paid family leave (though they may disagree over how to provide it), new research out in time for Father's Day suggests insufficient paid leave as well as social expectations prevent fathers from caring for their children as much as they'd like."
"Promundo and Dove Men+Care surveyed 1,714 men and women ages 25 to 45 and found no difference across gender about how involved they want to be in their kids' lives."
"Beyond worrying about their ability to pay for basic costs such as food and housing while on leave which is significant, given only 38 percent of workers qualify for and can afford to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, and only 15 percent of Americans have access to paid family leave fathers reported wanting to be involved, but that they also â€œworry what other will think if they prioritize their children over work."
"In 2017, the Pew Research Center similarly found that two-thirds of men wished they'd had more time after the birth of their child."
"Unsurprising, given that of the small subset of men who took paid leave, 7 in 10 men took less than two weeks."
Other research on paid leave confirms that paid leave with higher wage replacement rates (the percentage of their regular income they will receive while taking leave) is key to men taking time off.
Higher-income Americans and women are more likely to have access than lower-income Americans and men.
"According to the study, social and work environments determine whether men feel comfortable taking leave and fully embracing caregiving responsibilities: whether they feel in control over their work lives, have access to flexible work arrangements, and perceive that their workplace and parents would support them in taking on more caregiving responsibilities."
The pressure for women to exit the workforce and to focus on caregiving when they become mothers works in the opposite direction for men: men in the study reported feeling more pressure to prioritize work over their home lives than women.
"This might be due to the fact that women have more practice juggling work and care, or because they're often pushed out of the full-time workforce when they have kidsâ€”a big source of the wage gap."
"However, both men and women who reported being satisfied with their childcare involvement also reported being more satisfied with their personal, work, and sex life."
"Nonetheless, the study also found that both men and women still perceive women to be better caregivers in terms of daily planning, emotional care, and physical care and men better earners, despite evidence that caregiving is a learned socialized behavior."
"The study builds off other research on masculinity by Promundo, like the ManBox, which describes the types of behaviors and roles men feel comfortable taking on, depending on how firmly they believe in being a traditional man's man defined by feelings of self-sufficiency, attractiveness, acting tough, aggression, and traditional gender roles, for example."
Getting more men to take paid leave may guard against all those negative outcomes.
"In Better Life Lab at New America's own review of the effect of paid leave on men (of which I am a co-author), we found a relationship between men taking paid leave, paternal health and longevity, and involved fathering."
Promundo's study adds yet another reason to support inclusive paid leave and free up families to make real decisions about caregiving in their lives.
"Gary Barker, founder and CEO of Promundo, says the study suggests getting men more involved in caregiving is possible, but for now, Dads need that extra nudge."
"From the outside, Sweden looks like the most equal country in the world."
"What men do, women do as well."
"The streets of Sweden's cities are full of both of them; they ride their bikes to work, they push children in strollers, they do groceries, they work in banks and they work in construction."
"The premise of gender equality, reflected as it is in the public division of labour, seems to be flourishing here."
"If there is a place in the world most committed to gender equality, this seems to be it."
"Even the country's foreign policy advertises itself as a 'feminist' foreign policy, committed to realising the principles of gender equality."
Sweden's international development programmes are thus required to make gender equality the first priority.
"But at home, things are a bit different."
"The equal division of labour that one imagines is the private dimension of gender equality men and women doing the dishes, purchasing the groceries and performing the million domestic chores that are involved in running a home are hard to realise even in a country so committed to gender equality."
"And there is data to back this: according to a recent study published by the European Sociological Review, equality is not the norm in every single relationship."
"The dishes are a symbol of shared work, of living a life together that reflects mutual respect rather than fear."
"Even more interestingly, the study finds that relationships in which men discount the domestic work done by their partners and do not share equally in it, reveal greater dissatisfaction with the relationship."
"In simple terms, husbands who do not do the dishes in Sweden face the highest risk of getting dumped."
"Another study from Australia, where (surprise, surprise) men and women do not share the housework, show similar results."
"With far less government support for realising gender equality in relationships, Australian women (like so many others in the rest of the world) find themselves saddled with hours and hours of extra work once children are born."
"This fact, the unwillingness of too many men to share in the housework, has been linked to Australia's very high divorce rate."
"The fix to the problem is simple in theory: in couples where both husband and wife work outside the home, they must share the domestic chores or at least responsibility for them."
Traditional gender roles combined with the pressures of an urbanising society means that women are saddled with both a career and all the responsibility of ensuring that the home runs smoothly.
Old but resilient ideas of manhood mean that many men are totally unwilling to share in the housework or even care for the children.
Both are easily dismissed as the realm of women; the man will be less of a man if he changes a nappy or if he cleans up the kitchen.
"Then again, there are the in-laws, particularly many mothers-in-law, who stand guard, ensuring that the work they did must now be heaped on the new woman in the house."
The darling sons of these women never do the dishes and never will do the dishes and very few will thank their wives for doing the work.
"Unlike the women in Sweden, who can easily choose divorce, Pakistani women saddled with all the dishes and none of the thank-you's have no recourse but to sigh and bear it."
"Some men and their mothers may consider this a victory, but this is not true."
"As any Pakistani woman knows, a home with such a lopsided power arrangement, where the separate branches of governance, male and female, are not balanced, is not a happy home."
"Even if it is true that men have always dominated, husbands have always ruled the home, what has been forever is not what can persist forever."
"Even in this moment of incipient political change, where the usual suspects and many others are leveraging their power and hedging their bets, few pause to consider that the imbalances of the public sphere are born of those that are constantly justified in the private sphere."
"When people are raised and reared in an environment that is often a tyranny, where power is never evenly distributed and one bossy force controls everything, they remain ill equipped to demand anything more in the public and political spheres."
"What works at home, everyone assumes, works everywhere else one side with all the power, everyone else with all the silent hatreds, all the unattended misgivings."
"The dishes, then, are a symbol of so much more than simply the dishes; sharing in the work of managing a life together reflects mutual respect rather than absolute fear."
"Relationships based on respect, on overcoming differences and sharing power, ones that ensure the happiness of all involved, are the bricks and bones of a truly healthy family."
"No one wants to do the dishes, but when everyone participates in doing them there is little opportunity for secret hatreds to grow and seethe and simmer."
"So it is with everything else; the home is, after all, the microcosm of the state as a whole, easy to rule with fear and intimidation but left vulnerable in its secret resentments."
"Even if they are silently borne, the weight of these secret grudges weighs the bonds that bind."
"A lifetime of inequality, of dishes dumped on one person, of power hogged by one side, is a persistent threat to the home and to the whole in which it exists."
"Part of a child's development is the process of beginning to understand, and grapple with, the complex concept of gender."
It's fairly well-established that awareness of gender emerges early in a child's life.
"And while this is an area where theory abounds, we found that there was a lack of empirical, or hard, evidence about the influences on children's perception of gender."
"Research done in 2007 among three to five-year-olds found that at an early age, these kids were able to identify girl toys and boy toys and predict whether their parents would approve or disapprove of their choice."
"In 2011, an American study of children aged between six and 10-years-old found that the stereotype that maths is for boys starts quite young."
"One study we looked at found that the more TV children of both sexes watched, the more likely they were to believe that boys are better"
"For little boys, watching television appears to reinforce their already positive self-regard, while for girls, watching television appears to dampen it."
"For boys, watching television appears to reinforce their already positive self-regard."
This is concerning given that there are more than twice as many male characters as there are female characters on kid's TV shows.
"But the type of TV shows our kids are watching can also have an influence on the type of play that they engage in: boys watching violent and superhero programs were more likely to play in gender stereotyped games; and for both boys and girls, watching Disney princesses waft about was associated with higher levels of female gender-stereotypical behaviour."
"Relatedly, there is also evidence toys are now more divided by gender than they were 50 years ago."
"What is concerning about this, is that certain types of toys like Lego and other construction toys typically marketed to boys, are thought to build skills that help mathematical reasoning."
"According to some, this may underpin the under-representation of women in maths and science."
"One minister in the UK said that toys marketed to boys boosted interest in science and maths and in the process, girls are discouraged from taking up maths and engineering jobs."
"While there's no specific research examining the relationship between toys and outcomes for boys, it's important to note that stereotypes can work against boys as well as girls."
"For example, one study among early childhood teachers in Spain showed many perceived girls as more caring and helpful than boys, and indeed, teachers expected this behaviour from girls."
But boys exhibiting prosocial behaviour like this were considered surprising even sometimes strange.
"According to research, toys marketed to boys boosted interest in science and maths."
"It's when these categories are then assigned rigid stereotypes, attitudes or beliefs about roles, behaviours or even worth, that they become problematic."
"We can never remove terms and categories that are a normal part of life such as boys and girls, nor should we."
"However, research does suggest that by minimising these distinctions on the basis of gender and making individual attributes and skills a priority, we can help reduce stereotypes, discrimination and bias, and instead, build inclusive behaviours in our children."
The language of love can have the power to transgress the barriers of different dialects.
"However, when it comes to sharing an understanding of gender roles in a relationship, some views can become lost in translation among binational European couples."
"A recent study investigated the expectations that heterosexual couples have about gender, with one of the pair originally coming from the UK and the other from a separate European country."
"The research discovered that British men often have a more traditional perception of relationships, while women from Europe prefer to uphold egalitarian beliefs."
The female participants who originally came from southern and eastern Europe admitted that they appreciated the opportunities that living in the UK had afforded them.
"I think men in England are a lot more independent than they are in Italy, said Chiara, an Italian woman with a British male partner."
"The British women interviewed who had European partners similarly preferred to break down the notions of gender stereotypes, with one revealing that her French male partner wanted her to act â€œa little bit more passive and a little bit more feminine."
"On the other hand, British men confessed that relationships in the UK can sometimes be perceived as fairly conservative in regard to gender roles."
"Generalising in many ways, we are very traditional in Britain in terms of relationships and expecting the man to do certain things and the women to do things, said James, a British man with a German female partner called Sabine."
"Jacques, a Belgian man with a British female partner, found the apparent separation of men and women in social scenarios in the UK strange, describing the atmosphere as more macho."
"As someone who has studied sexuality, I see a lot of truth in these discussions about masculinity and femininity."
"However, I'm guessing there are some diverging opinions, so be sure to share in the comments!"
"Since the beginning of time, relationships have been seen to consist of two properties, Feminine and Masculine."
"It's hard to pinpoint just exactly what each role entails but generally, when we look at history and the effects of hormones (Estrogen linked to Feminine and Testosterone linked to Masculine), it's quite easy to detect."
"Masculine roles are usually strong, aggressive and more logical or analytical."
"Feminine roles, on the other hand, are generally more sensitive, nurturing and intuitive."
"Sure, there are relationships that can survive with only one gender role present."
"However, they might not last long and could be interspersed with a lot of emotionally charged events."
"Though some might think of this as a good thing, in the long run, it might prove to be too mentally and emotionally exhausting."
It takes one person to be calm and passive (at least until things calm down) in order for the situation to unfurl itself and become less tense.
Sometimes Men are from Venus and Women are from Mars Gender roles are also not restricted to the gender itself.
We don't strictly define women as being feminine or men as being masculine.
"We have seen many wonderful men playing feminine roles in a relationship, whether they're straight or gay."
"After all, you don't need to be a man to be dominant or aggressive, right?"
The other person has to be more stable so that he/she can calm the sensitive person down.
"When both gender roles are present, problems can be tackled from many different directions due to the variety of traits present in the couple."
Each person will bring a different perspective to the table and the combination of these outlooks will make them formidable
"If one of them has their logic stump them in dire conditions, the other might rely on their intuition to help find a solution."
"Gender Roles and Fluidity As explained above, these roles are not restricted to the gender itself, as not all men fulfill masculine roles and not all women fulfill feminine roles."
"Just because you're deemed as the masculine one, it doesn't mean you have to be masculine or that you have to do masculine tasks all the time."
Gender roles are not as important in platonic friendships because we can have many different friends that provide both gender roles that we seek at different times.
Gender roles are also not as apparent in parent-child relationships.
"From there, segregate them into masculine and feminine roles."
"Inside every man is a boy who forgets he’s a man. Every boy gets into things, not because he’s bad but because he’s got a curious mind and a short attention span."
"Unconditional support from women is what will snap men out of their boyish behavior and inject them with a desire to be a stronger man. Only when women accept men as they are, who they are, will they want to become someone better."
"When women don’t express themselves, they leave men in the dark."
So many women don’t tell their men how they feel because they don’t want to rock the boat.
"Women are prepackaging and presenting parts of their life instead of doing their whole life with men. Every time women hold things in, they are building walls inside the sacred space of the relationship."
Men are visual creatures.
Men don’t really know the truth of women.
Men need things spelled out. Men are logical creatures.
"For men, communication is not their specialty. Men tend to pull from a logical place while women pull from an emotional place. If women can meet men at logic, men will match women’s emotions."
Watching women sweat and work on your body only encourages men to work on theirs as well.
"There is something men get from their boys (male friends) that men just can’t get from women and there’s nothing women can do to give men that because it’s a relationship dynamic, a comradely that men have with men."
"Of course men want to be supportive of everything women care about and be a part of anything women would like men to be a part of, but men want women to have their own identity."
Men are often reluctant to talk about their needs in intimate relationships.
"Whether social conditioning or an inability to communicate their needs are to blame, men (who tend to be the less communicative partners in intimate relationships) are prone to silently suffering when their emotional needs aren’t being met by their partners."
Men have infamously tender egos.
"Men need frequent reassurance about themselves, their career paths, their efficacy as partners, their sexual prowess, and their attractiveness (among other things)."
"While it may be true that men need relatively less frequent verbal praise than their female counterparts, this isn’t the kind of gesture that requires keeping score."
"The more you praise men’ positives, the more you will see men."
Men feel respect as love.
"If he feels like she disapprove of him, his career, or the things that he believes to be integral to who he is as a person, he will have a hard time trusting and loving her."
"“If she doesn’t respect who he is at his core, then how can she really want what is best for him?”"
"If a man’s partner doesn’t respect his path or mission in life, then he will find it very difficult to feel other than an anxious need to distance himself from her."
Women connect better through communication and men connect better through sex.
"Men, more often than not, connect through indicators of sexual access just as much as they do through sex."
"Often, a man will initiate sex just to make sure that his female-counterpart is still sexually available to him."
"From a very young age, men are taught to avoid appearing weak at all costs — perceived “weakness” includes things like complaining, divulging fears or concerns, and expressing self-doubt or worry."
A man’s partner is his safe space to fall — he can expose the cracks in his armour and allow his partner to help him heal.
"Just as women need to slowly open up sexually within a relationship, men open up over time emotionally."
"If a woman pushes her man away or is unable to be nurturing when he needs it the most, he will no longer trust her with his emotions."
Men consistently see that it is the feminine-associated female partner that wants more time spent together and the masculine-associated male partner wanting more time apart.
Suffocating a man (either by failing to allow him free time or with overly jealous behaviour) is the fastest way to end a relationship.
Men need breathing room in a relationship.
"Men need time for their hobbies, time with their friends, and time to toil away on their projects to feel fulfilled."
"When women (or the feminine associated partner) need to solve a problem, they go further into the tribe – connecting with close friends and family and discussing their issues — when men have a problem to solve, they leave the tribe to be alone with their thoughts."
Men feel secure in knowing that their partners approve of them and where they are in their career.
Men feel secure when they are allowed to have their guys’ nights away from you and you don’t feel the need to call or text them every half hour to check in.
"Needless to say, a positive outlook of women on life is attractive while a constant negative attitude on things can be a huge turnoff to men. If you are positive, then men will be likely to feel positive as well and that can only help your relationship."
Most men do not like to show their feelings all the time.
Something that a man will really want in a relationship is for his partner to be his safe space.
He needs to know that you will not be disgusted if he breaks down and cries in front of you.
A man wants a woman who can see the cracks in his armor and will still love him anyway.
"If a guy wants to be in a relationship, it means that he does not just want the physical intimacy — he wants to be emotionally close to you as well."
"For a good number of men, respect and love go hand in hand. Men need respect in their love lives and the respect that you show him will also show your love for him as well."
"While men typically do not need as much praise as women, being praised by their significant others can positively impact their confidence and self-esteem."
"If he is the main breadwinner in the relationship, let him know that you appreciate his hard work and what he does for your household."
Men love to be appreciated and recognized for the things they do whether they are large or small.
No man wants a woman who will act like their mother.
"While women connect better through the act of communication, men are known to connect better through the act of physical intimacy."
A man will want someone who can deal with the situation in a mature way.
"While you should not drastically change yourself to fit into what a man would want from a relationship, you also need to consider that a relationship is a two-way street."
Women tend to think they’re being respectful when they’re considerate.
"We, women think it’s respectful to clean up so we don’t leave a mess for him, or to reheat his dinner when he comes home late, or to pick up his dry cleaning when we’re out."
"To give men the respect they want, women need to demonstrate that they have faith in men’s capabilities."
Your man wants to know that he can make your life better–that he can contribute to your happiness.
Men don’t really care if their partners ever do anything for them (except respect their thinking and competency).
"Men want to be able to lighten their female partners’ load, make them smile, make them laugh, protect them and give them the things you want."
Your man wants to be able to compliment you and know that you received it — even if it’s that you look beautiful when you just cleaned the toilet.
"If you receive your man’s extravagant gift that you could have lived without, his offers to take you out to dinner even though you already defrosted the salmon, his compliments even though they make you uncomfortable—he’ll be getting so much of what he wants from you, he’ll be ridiculously happy."
Respect is the best aphrodisiac for men.
Men want women to create emotional safety by being open but not demanding.
A woman that would enter into a romantic relationship with you needs to understand that sex is a massive part of how you express yourself emotionally.
Finding a girl with a good attitude is probably the hardest one.
Don’t go out and date a girl that can’t keep at least as positive an outlook on life as you can.
I know it’s not 1847 and a man can keep his own house in order but when a woman works with you to maintain that home it produces a beautiful relationship vibe that lets a fella know that his children are safe in her care.
Focus on chicks that look like they know how to keep their place looking as good as you do.
"You want your future love to treat you like a man, not like she’s your mom."
A good woman understands that a man doesn’t have to be all up under you to be in love with you.
"If your woman has to Facebook, tweet and/or Instagram every place, meal and adventure you guys undertake, beware."
"If your girl is more interested in taking Facebook selfies than in just enjoying the walk through the ancient ruins of Macu Picchu with you, she may be more into the projection of your relationship than the romance itself."
"A girl may say she hangs with the guys more than her girlfriends or a guy may in fact be more sensitive than the average, however, they are still from completely different and separate planets."
Men and women need to appreciate these differences and stop expecting their partner to act and feel the same way he/she does.
"Men do not rate feelings as highly in their minds as women, while women don’t rate abilities as high as men. Men love to have their abilities recognized and appreciated and hate to have them scorned or ignored."
Women love to have their feelings recognized and appreciated and hate to have them ignored.
Men like to solve problems on their own yet women like to solve problems in the relationship as a team.
"Men can sometimes view unsolicited assistance as an undermining of their effort to solve problems alone while women value assistance, and thus view unsolicited solutions as undermining their effort to proceed interactively."
Men want their solutions to be appreciated; women want their assistance to be appreciated and somewhere along the line all this gets misunderstood.
"When faced with tough times, men become non-communicative so they can work out how best to help themselves, while women become communicative so that others can work out how best to help them."
"When men do communicate, they like to get to the point, but women enjoy talking for its own sake."
Men talk in very literal terms while women use a more artistic and dramatic vocabulary to fully express their feelings. Men like to sort their thoughts out before communicating them and thus become distant and non-communicative as they ponder their feelings. Women like to sort their thoughts out by talking about them and have the tendency to provide a repetition of grievances as they express their concerns.
"A man's instinct is to look after himself first and foremost, while women have valued their independence long before they were even given civil rights."
Men feel gratified when they are left to sort things out by themselves and feel undermined by being offered sympathy or help while women feel the opposite. Women feel gratified by being offered support and feel undermined when they are left to sort things out by themselves.
"Men emotionally bolt when they fear that their self-sufficiency is threatened. When women fear that their self-sufficiency is threatened, they emotionally sink into themselves."
"If women cannot find any real issues to concentrate on, then they will find some random other thing to worry about."
"If women are supported and allowed enough time to express and release their negative feelings, they will start to feel happy again and return to their usual selves."
"When women feel loved, they relax and open to men — the arguments dissipate, the sex is abundant, and their nurturing feminine energy flows throughout men’s lives."
Not feeling loved is the subtext of every argument that you and your female counterpart have.
"If she is unhappy that you are going out with your friends, or she’s upset about her day at work, or she is only responding to you with brief snippets of sentences, then the cause is most likely her not feeling loved enough."
"There is a war being waged on women’s self-esteem, sexuality, and safety from a very young age."
"Because of the barrage of disempowering messages being sent to women regarding their sexuality, women need to have a safe space where they feel that they can trust their partners."
"By creating a safe space for your woman to open up to you emotionally and sexually, you will be giving her a very powerful gift- you allow her to grow within your relationship and undo old emotional damage."
"Just as masculine energy has the need to protect, feminine energy has the desire to nurture."
Women want men to notice everything in them.
"Most of the times, women are in the situation of self-doubt."
Women want to be constantly in touch with their male counterpart because they feel incomplete when they don’t talk to their partners.
"Women are always fond of love — they have like a full ocean of love and in every relationship, all they want is love."
Women want to be able to be strong without men being threatened.
"There are many strong, confident women in the world who take on leadership roles at work and other areas of their life, but subsequently feel that this intimidates men who immediately shy away from them."
Men need to understand that being with a strong woman does not emasculate them.
Women want to feel safe being vulnerable with men.
No matter how strong or powerful someone is – man or woman – none of us are bulletproof.
"We all could use a little taking care of sometimes, and feeling safe around a man is one of the most important gifts we can give to a woman."
"Women appreciate gifts and nice things, but they also understand that they are no substitute for your loyalty, love, respect, and time. "
Women want men to be consistent.
"I have heard too many stories about men who are Prince Charming for the first month or two of the relationship until there is a commitment, and then they turn into a completely different person — [Hint: They did not actually change, they just finally stopped putting up a facade]."
Women want to be respected as men’s equal.
Women want men to make them laugh.
"When it comes to keeping a woman’s attention: Manners are important, good looks are a bonus, but humor is a must.Women want to feel desired."
There is a big difference between talking at a woman and talking with a woman.
A real man isn’t defined just by his machismo.
A real man isn’t just a smooth talker or a guy who tries to fit in.
Women should raise kids and manage households.

Men don’t want to be your Clark Kent.
Men want to carry women in their arms and show women the world or at least feel that way.
Men want to be your Superman.
Men want women to see them as leaping tall buildings in a single bound and catching bullets.
Nothing gives men more strength than a woman who creates a space that makes them feel invincible.
"If women make men feel invincible, they will make women feel beautiful. For men, their invincible is women’s beautiful."
"Whether social conditioning or an inability to communicate our needs are to blame, men (who tend to be the less communicative partners in intimate relationships) are prone to silently suffering when their emotional needs aren't being met by their partners."
"Whether you are a man or a woman reading this article, this will give you greater clarity into yourself/partner and what your/their needs are in your intimate relationship."
"Let's put an end to the needless fighting due to miscommunication, the unnecessary sex-less nights, and the verbal shut-downs."
Here are seven things all men need in a relationship.
I have countless male clients telling me every month that their partners rarely let them know what they like about them.
"While it may be true that men need relatively less frequent verbal praise than their female counterparts, this isn't the kind of gesture that requires keeping score."
"So ladies, let your praise loose."
Tell your man exactly what you find attractive about him.
Let him know what physical features of his are your favourites.
"Tell him how attractive you find it when he says something a certain way, when he accomplishes something, or when he takes you on a date."
Your praise won't make him cocky; it will help him feel loved.
"If he feels like you disapprove of him, his career, or the things that he believes to be integral to who he is as a person, he will have a hard time trusting and loving you."
"The thought process behind that being ""If she doesn't respect who I am at my core, then how can she really want what is best for me?"""
"If a man's partner doesn't respect his path or mission in life, then he will find it very difficult to feel other than an anxious need to distance himself from her."
"A Sense Of Sexual Connection Men and women both connect through sex and communication, but generally, women connect better through communication and men connect better through sex."
Does this mean that men need to have sex with their intimate partners every day in order to feel connected?
"Often, a man will initiate sex just to make sure that you are still sexually available to him."
"So, to my man-loving readers out there, if he reaches across the bed for you, even showing the willingness to embrace him, to kiss him deeply, and to romantically engage him could be enough to make him feel loved (not that the follow through isn't enjoyable)."
This lack of awareness around women needing to connect through words and men needing to connect through sex can sometimes turn into an unfortunate and rapid downward spiral.
"She doesn't feel like opening sexually until she feels connected to him, but he finds it difficult to communicate with her because they haven't been physical with each other in days."
Talk with your partner and ask what specifically helps them feel the most loved so you can avoid these unintentional standoffs.
"Emotional Intimacy From a very young age, men are taught to avoid appearing weak at all costs."
A man's partner is his safe space to fall.
He can expose the cracks in his armour and allow his partner to help him heal.
"He needs to make sure that when he first cries in front of you, you won't be repelled or handle it poorly."
"If you push him away or are unable to be nurturing when he needs it the most, he will no longer trust you with his emotions."
He will remove himself somewhat from the relationship.
"In this instance, both partners lose- he goes on silently suffering and believing that he is flawed in his imperfection, and she is held at arm's length emotionally."
Space Author Deborah Tannen has written brilliantly on the masculine and feminine divide between independence and intimacy (masculine being primarily drawn towards independence and the feminine toward intimacy).
"Within all of my relationships and the vast majority of my clients, I consistently see that it is the feminine-associated female partner that wants more time spent together and the masculine-associated male partner wanting more time apart."
There is no perfect balance to be found here.
This will always be a balancing act of closeness and separateness.
"But rest assured, suffocating a man (either by failing to allow him free time or with overly jealous behaviour) is the fastest way to end a relationship."
"We need time for our hobbies, time with our friends, and time to toil away on our projects to feel fulfilled."
"Traditionally, when women (or the feminine associated partner) needed to solve a problem, they would go further into the tribe connecting with close friends and family and discussing their issues."
"Conversely, when men have a problem to solve, they would leave the tribe to be alone with their thoughts."
Leave him to his own devices.
"A man will be that much happier for you to receive him when he returns, knowing that you trust both him and the strength of your bond enough to let him have his space."
Men need frequent non-sexual touch as well as a sense of sexual access.
"If a man's partner comes up behind him and touches his neck and hair in a loving way while he sits absorbed in a task, he could feel just as loved as if they had just had penetrative sex (even more so, depending on his mood)."
Security Men and women are both attracted to certainty in a relationship.
"The more a man feels like his partner is in it for the long haul, the more ready and able he is to be able to open up to her (assuming he is equally invested in her)."
But security goes deeper than just the fact that you won't leave him.
The security that he feels ties back in to several of these points.
He feels secure in knowing that you approve of him and where he is in his career.
He feels secure and loved when you touch him non-sexually throughout the day.
He feels secure when he is allowed to have his guys' nights away from you and you don't feel the need to call or text him every half hour to check in.
And he feels secure with a partner who takes steps to love him in the way that he most needs.
What Men Want In A Relationship So how do you stack up in your relationship?
"If you are a man reading this, do you feel like all of your needs are being met?"
Could you ask for your partner to do something differently?
"If you are someone who is in a relationship with a man and you are reading this, how could you love him more fully?"
Which of these can you incorporate more of into your relationship?
"Even if you don't agree with every point made, let these articles begin a dialogue about both of your needs in your relationship."
This is about loving people in the best way that they could possibly be loved and opening up a dialogue about emotional needs in relationships.
Want to see what women need in a relationship?
Open any beauty magazine and you'll see article upon article about what women want in relationships and how to get it.
But there's rarely a space for men to express their relationship needs.
But nothing gives us more strength than a woman who creates a space that makes us feel invincible.
"If you make us feel invincible, we'll make you feel beautiful."
"But for men, our invincible is your beautiful."
"Because we NEED to feel that when we stack the dishes in the dishwasher like a five year-old, say the wrong thing in front of your friends, leave the toilet seat up, get too logical, forget something you've said a thousand times, that you love us anyways."
Because inside every man is a boy who forgets he's a man sometimes.
"And every boy gets into things, not because he's bad but because he's got a curious mind and a short attention span."
Unconditional support from our woman is what will snap us out of our boyish behavior and inject us with a desire to be a stronger man.
So many women don't tell their men how they feel because they don't want to rock the boat.
Men are going to look.
"But blinder sex gets us to say: ""she may be pretty but I would never trade in what I have for anything else."""
"Generally speaking, men tend to pull from a logical place."
Women pull from an emotional place.
Sweat There's nothing sexier than working out with your intimate partner.
Man dates There is something we get from our boys (male friends) that we just can't get from you.
"And there's nothing you can do to give us that because it's a relationship dynamic, a comradery that men have with men."
You have the same when you go dancing with your girlfriends.
It fulfills a different part of us.
And it refuels us and want to be with you more.
"It's also going to sharpen us and make us better men, assuming our boys are not boys but real men."
"Of course we want to be supportive of everything you care about and be a part of anything you would like us to be a part of, but we want you to have your own identity."
"Because if you have nothing that is yours, our relationship is standing on one leg."
"Also, if you have your own life, it forces us to get our own life as well or risk losing you."
Forget legs.
Let's put our relationship on wheels.
One is yours.
Love that makes you a grilled cheese with aged cheddar and gruyere the morning after Super Bowl Sunday with the fellas.
"You gotta be true, you gotta be legit, you gotta be masculine and you have to be serious about giving the love you want returned to you."
None of this stuff matters if you're a sockpuppethead asshole who enjoys humping and dumping chicks for sport.
Take your bullshit low self-esteeem-having ass elsewhere until you figure out what it means to be a man that truly loves a woman.
"When you figure it out, come back here and learn you some shit, bro."
The testosterone that makes you hairy like a lumberjack is the same thing that gets you tossed out of the titty bar for grabbin' on the girly bits.
Women tend to get it twisted and think that you're in the relationship because you just want her for sex.
"As such, she wants to make sure that you love her for other shit too."
"Thing is, you already do love her for all that other shit because you just want HER for sex' not anyone else."
"If she's a real woman, that's flattering as fuck and enough encouragement for her to throw you a bone a few times a week."
Has a good attitude Finding a girl with a good attitude is probably the hardest one in here.
"Because except for gas being cheaper than it's been in years, the world is kinda shitty right now."
"And despite the fact that student loans are weighing on your head, your mom's pressuring you to settle down and your job is nowhere near where you wanted your career to be you maintain a good attitude about it all."
Don't go out and date a girl that can't keep at least as positive an outlook on life as you can.
"Lewis Black is funny n' shit, but you don't wanna marry his real life female equivalent, do you?"
"Well, if she's as rich as he is I can understand making an exception."
"Keeps a clean home Yeah, I know it's not 1847 and a man can keep his own house in order."
But when a woman works with you to maintain that home it produces a beautiful relationship vibe that lets a fella know that his children are safe in her care.
"Sex is cool and everything and chasing tail has its fun, but if you're dating it's because you, eventually, want to get married."
So focus on chicks that look like they know how to keep their place looking as good as you do.
"You want your future love to treat you like a man, not like she's your mom."
Cool with leaving us the fuck alone It's not that your girl doesn't have interesting things to say.
We're not trying to steal away time to talk to some other girl.
A good woman understands that a man doesn't have to be all up under you to be in love with you.
It'd be cool if she had her own stuff too.
"Whether it's gathering Pinterest recipes, sewing stuff, building RC cars, gardening, or hustling at the poker table at the casino, she has something she can do that doesn't have to have anything to do with you."
Ain't it cool when a woman that can ask you about your day and actually care?
"If there's a problem, she has insight to offer."
If there's a difficulty she has a comforting word.
"And she doesn't just relate the things you say back to her, she listens to you because she's interested in your personal comfort and growth in the context of the relationship."
"That, alone, is almost worth a month's salary on a glittery bauble."
"She doesn't put a lot of stock in social media If your woman has to Facebook, tweet and/or Instagram every place, meal and adventure you guys undertake, beware."
"So if your chick is more interested in taking Facebook selfies than in just enjoying the walk through the ancient ruins of Macu Picchu with you, she may be more into the projection of your relationship than the romance itself."
"She can put her phone down, ""Have you ever seen that one couple at the restaurant?'"
"They're dressed up, looking sweet and sitting across from each other over a beautifully ornate table with fine linens in their lap."
And instead of talking to each other or relishing in the promise of a passionate eveningâ€¦they're on their phones?
Don't be that guy.
And don't date someone that likes being that girl.
"When you're in front of her, her attention is on you."
And when her phone rings she doesn't have to check it to know whether she'll get it later.
She just leaves it the fuck alone.
Gorgeous.
Makes fitness a priority You ever see the look a girl gives you when you put on a fitted shirt and it looks goooood?
Men and women are at an emotional stalemate.
We feel something's lacking in our relationships.
"The majority of men aren't able to penetrate their women fully, nor are women fully opening to their men."
Women aren't opening because men aren't giving them what they need.
Women feel disappointed and resentful; they are suffering.
"When women suffer, and they feel like they aren't being seen, they close off to their men."
"Fortunately, you can learn the right tools to be able to more fully penetrate your woman."
"You can give your partner what she needs, allowing her to feel seen so that she will open again."
Take the time to read through these needs.
"Understanding what you can do to help your partner fully open will not only improve your relationship, but it will improve your entire life."
Here are the seven things that all women want in a relationship.
"To Feel Loved When women feel loved, they relax and open to us."
"The arguments dissipate, the sex is abundant, and their nurturing feminine energy flows throughout our lives."
Not feeling loved is the subtext of every argument that you and your partner have.
"If she is unhappy that you are going out with your friends, or she's upset about her day at work, or she is only responding to you with brief snippets of sentences, then the cause is most likely her not feeling loved enough."
"Learn to see through her words, actions, and moods and see what the real root of it is."
"There is a war being waged on women's self-esteem, sexuality, and safety from a very young age."
She wants to trust your strength.
She wants to feel like you can handle whatever she shows you.
She wants to feel like you will not judge her if she asks for something risque.
She wants to know you won't collapse in defeat if she tells you to do it.
Women want to feel seen.
"She wants to feel you hearing her, and being aware of her emotional state."
"She doesn't necessarily want you to be affected by her emotional state, but she does want you to be witness to it."
"If she is sitting across the room from you and you aren't picking up on the fact that she is suffering emotionally and on the verge of tears, she will begin to trust you less."
"She will think, â€œIf he can't see that I am hurting now, how long will it take him to figure it out?"
Will I be suffering for days or weeks before he is aware of it or cares enough to help me through this?
I guess I have to rely on myself for my own emotional supportâ€.
"Life can seem extremely lonely, even within a relationship."
You have to constantly show your partner that at least one person will be witness to her and her journey through life.
Women want to see the cracks in our armour.
They want to see that we trust them enough to open up to them.
They want to be able to help us through our sadness.
"An integrated, evolved man who has a balanced masculine energy as well as his own sliver of feminine would welcome his woman's nurturing."
"If you are a guy reading this, have you ever held open a door for a woman because it's the polite thing to do (but more just because she's a person and it wasn't even a gender-based act) and she chews your ear off for it?"
I can't open the door for myself because I'm a woman?
You sexist pig!
"That is an example of a wounded, unbalanced woman who doesn't want to accept help from a masculine source."
This is exactly how it feels to your partner when you push her away when you feel the most vulnerable.
This lack of vulnerability and authenticity is what is making you and your partner suffer.
She wants to love you.
Men mess up their relationships in these three specific ways.
To Feel Sexually Desired What's a major difference between your relationship to your partner and your relationship to everyone else in your life?
You have sex with your partner.
Women need to feel sexually desired.
"They want to make sure that you see and appreciate them as a feminine, sexual being."
Praise her body.
Feel her and grab her appreciatively.
Remind her that you see her as a sexual being and you will both benefit.
To Be Appreciated The feminine in all people responds primarily to praise and appreciation.
Remind your partner that you love her.
Tell her that you appreciate what she brings to your life.
Show her how much she means to you.
The fastest way to run your relationship into the ground is by ignoring your partner and taking her for granted.
Appreciation is the opposite of those things.
"Appreciation is the embodying this mindset: â€œI am aware of what you bring to my life, and I want you to be sure that I am aware of it as wellâ€."
"So tell her what you appreciate, and tell her often."
To Feel Like She Can Count On You Life gets pretty messy sometimes.
"When life's unavoidable difficulties arise, do you fall apart under pressure or are you able to bend and not break?"
Women want to know that we can handle ourselves when life happens.
"When you tell your partner you'll do something, and then you don't do it, it hurts her."
She loses a piece of trust in you that has to be earned back.
"Even seemingly small things break that trust like you saying that you will wash the dishes shortly after dinner, but washing them the next morning instead."
"When enough small transgressions like this are sprinkled throughout your relationship, she will distrust you."
"Do what you say you will do, be who you say you are, and be consistent in your actions."
What Do Women Need In A Relationship?
Women want partners that care.
Women don't want perfect partners; they want men who are striving to be their best selves.
"She doesn't necessarily want someone who has every step of his life pre-planned, but she wants someone with drive and with goals."
"She doesn't necessarily want someone who cries every day, but she does want someone who has the courage to cry in front of her when he needs to."
"She doesn't necessarily want someone who stays in therapy for his entire life, but she does want someone who has the courage to face his own emotional demons."
Decide that you want to be in the kind of relationship that most people don't have and you want to put in the effort necessary to become that kind of man.
The women of the world are waiting for us.
And they want us to step up just as badly as we want them to open up.
Things All Men Need In A Relationship.
The biggest difference is that you may notice that none of the above seven things are unique to being female and/or feminine desires or needs.
All seven things mentioned above are human needs.
Think about that when you read any listicle separating men and women into dichotomous monoliths.
This question has been puzzling men since the evaluation of romantic relationships.
Men from around the globe feel frustrated because they are always in the dilemma of what pleases their better halves.
"Men always have a hard time understanding their love and relationship, while on the other hand, women always take care of what her beloved's need."
She is aware of all the need of her man and gives her all to keep him happy.
Is that because women are more sensitive?
or is that because men are way too practical in handling their relationships?
"Many men have wrong notions in their mind, that a woman will feel happy if he takes her out on expensive dates."
Others think that women are so obsessed with all those fairy tale love stories that they really want everything in their love life and in their man to be perfect.
All these notions are correct but it's the mindset which differs.
Let's try to unfold that- What do women want in a relationship to be happy?
She wants him to notice everything in her.
"Ongoing on a date, she arranges all the things to look perfect for her man."
"From her dress to her sandals, from her hair to her nail polish, she does everything so that she can look beautiful for the special day."
"But, all her efforts go into vain when her man doesn't notice her new hairstyle!"
"It seems to be a very small thing to men to notice hairstyles, but women love it when she gets a compliment for something so unobtrusive."
Attention is all she needs.
Men need to pay attention to her when she's talking about someone she doesn't like or when she's describing an incident.
"If her man doesn't pay attention to her, she eventually stops making efforts to include him in her life."
"When it comes to equality in a relationship, it means that equal hold on a relationship."
"Equality in a relationship means equal freedom to express views, opinions and take decisions."
A relationship is something which cannot be led by a single person.
"So, a woman always wants her man to give her equal importance to decide and execute things."
"This equality can be covered within the biggest or the smallest things in life, like from equality to choose career opportunities to equality to select the venue for the date, everything should be considered."
"When a woman is in a relationship, she has to be respected for her views upon something."
"The man needs to respect his woman for her likes, dislikes, how she looks or how she wants to lead her life."
"Correcting her is fine, but forcing her to be someone she is not internally, is disrespectful for her individuality."
"Respect her for what she is, correct her when she is wrong but never try to change her!"
"This is because the glamor industry has set up unmatchable goals of ""How a woman should look?"""
"A perfect toned body, flawless skin and sexy presence are all which sums up the women in the magazines, movies or advertisements."
"Such goals create insecurity within her, especially when her man appreciates what he sees on TV and tells her to look that."
"Well, no one is like that, every woman in those glossy advertisements is wearing tons of makeup and hiding her flaws behind camera tricks."
"In such a situation of ever-changing fashion and competition of looking prettier than her fellows, she needs her man to appreciate her for her natural beauty."
She loves it when she gets a compliment for just who she is.
"It creates a sense of security in her that no matter at what stage of life she's going to be, her man is always going to love her."
"A woman always takes care of everything she loves, men somehow are not so capable of showing their care."
"Obviously, men do care but fail to show."
"Men may find this caring attitude of women nagging sometimes because they feel women try to control their lives when she asks about his lunch, his meetings, and his celebrations."
But she does all this because she genuinely cares about what you're doing and How are you?
"Same, she expects from her man."
She expects that her man also shows her that he cares.
She needs his care when she has a bad day or when she feels at the top of town!
Women are always fond of love.
"They have like a full ocean of love and in every relationship, all she wants is love."
"Considering men's point that women love expensive dates is right but she loves those dates, not because of the restaurant or the food, she loves those because she's getting time from the person she loves the most."
She wants to be constantly in touch with you because she feels incomplete when she doesn't talk to you.
"Men have to understand that just saying 'I Love You' is not enough, they need to show that they genuinely love his partner."
Women are not all complicated to understand.
It's just men's notion to escape from the situation but they need to understand that escaping is not the solution.
A woman needs to feel loved!
She considers even the smallest efforts of her man in a relationship.
"Thus, she never fails to express her love and appreciate his efforts."
"Her man is important to her, maybe that's why she remembers everything whatever her man has ever said!"
It is often discussed how difficult it is to understand women.
"While many times this may seem to be the case, I don't think it necessarily has to be."
She wants to be able to be strong without you being threatened.
"If this is part of her natural personality, we as men need to decide how we feel about it."
We need to understand that being with a strong woman does not emasculate us.
"If anything, it gives us a teammate in life who we can face challenges alongside as an equal teammate."
"She wants you to take this as part of her, because it is."
She wants to feel safe being vulnerable with you.
"No matter how strong or powerful someone is ""man or woman"" none of us are bulletproof."
"Able to open up and show her feelings, uncensored."
"If she can't do this, nothing else will matter."
"She wants your time, not your gifts."
"Sure, women appreciate gifts and nice things, but they also understand that they are no substitute for your loyalty, love, respect, and time."
Those are the things she really wants.
She wants you to be consistent.
"I have heard too many stories about men who are Prince Charming for the first month or two of the relationship until there is a commitment, and then they turn into a completely different person."
"They should not fade over time, but increase as she becomes a bigger and more important part of your life."
She wants to be respected as your equal.
She wants you to make her laugh.
"When it comes to keeping a woman's attention: Manners are important, good looks are a bonus, but humor is a must."
"Having a great sense of humor is not only important for enjoying each other's company, but also helping to cope with challenges and keep moods light."
Just make sure you don't make jokes when inappropriate.
She wants to be trusted.
"Sure, everyone has to earn trust but if she hasn't done anything to make you suspicious and you are that way towards her, it will make her feel undervalued and even begin to wonder if you may be hiding something that you are projecting onto her."
She wants to be able to trust you.
"And she will, over time, as long as you don't give her a reason not to."
"In fact, you both have to trust each other for the relationship to have any hope at working."
This is one of the very basic building blocks.
She wants to feel desired.
It's not just a matter of calling her beautiful.
It is a matter of making her feel beautiful.
"The way you touch her, the way you look at her, the way you subtly rest your hand on the small of her back when introducing her to someone or when you lay your hand on her knee when you're driving."
The small things that make her feel close to you both physically and emotionally.
That connection will go farther than compliments ever will.
She wants to be able to count on you.
"A step beyond trust, she wants you to be reliable."
"Possibly not the sexiest trait for a man to have, but still one of the most important."
"If a woman is committing herself to you, she has to know that you will be there for her during both the good times and the bad."
During the stormy days just as much as the sunny days.
"Because being there for someone when it's most difficult, is really all that a relationship is."
She wants you to just listen.
"When a woman tells you about her problems, it doesn't mean that she's complaining or that she's looking for a solution from you."
It just means that she trusts you enough to open up and vent to you.
We as men naturally try to offer suggestions to help or find a solution for her.
"Stop, he just wants you to give her the support she needs to find the solution herself."
She wants more than five minutes of foreplay.
"Yes, I went there, because it's important you guys."
She wants to communicate with you.
There is also a big difference between hearing her and really listening to her.
She wants you to be honest.
She wants you to accept her as she is.
She wants you to love and accept her as she is while you support her as she grows into the woman she wants to be.
"Because after all, when you truly love someone, everything about them automatically becomes beautiful."
"Women want a guy that is going to be spontanous, that is going to be able to drop everything for her."
"Spontaneity is absolutely one of the most important things women want in a relationship and truthfully, it can be as simple as showing up with a bundle of flowers just because you were thinking about her."
Women should be submissive to men - Patriarchal Princesses International (PPI) A group calling itself Patriarchal Princesses International has called on all women to be submissive to their men.
"According to the group, some people have leverage on the concept of feminism to pollute the minds of young girls."
"In a press statement signed by Victoria Dede Nyarko, the group says they are bent on upholding the old customs of women submitting to the men in their lives."
Below is full statement We the members of Patriarchal Princesses International who are also known as Sugardemministries and we are calling on all women to be submissive to men.
"As an all-female purpose- driven Organization, it's our ultimate priority to conserve, restore and uphold moral values to enrich the human experience for the benefit of all."
"We are making this clarion call because it has come to our notice that, some people are polluting the minds of other women by preaching false doctrines in the name of ""feminism""."
"Throughout history, we agree some men have abused their spouses and maltreated their women terribly."
"Again, We know a section of society took the intrinsic differences between males and females and distorted them."
"Last but not least, we believe some of our cultural hang-ups about women were wrong."
"But in our spirited and noble efforts in searching for peace in our homes and the public space, we should not antagonize men and the society!"
"Its high time women understood that aside dominion that God gave both the male and the female equal rights, the purpose and design of Men are far different from Women."
"Men no matter their age, have the legal mandate to "" Lord"" over women and it is the role of women to submit to men."
God in his infinite wisdom gave both the male and Female dominion to subdue the earth.
This means both the male and the female are at liberty to achieve their aims on earth to the highest level to the Glory of their Maker.
"Nonetheless, high academic laurels and elevated social status doesn't give a woman legal grounds to maltreat, attack or be disrespectful to men."
A woman must submit to a man's authority.
"Submission doesn't mean a woman should be weak, compromise her moral values or tell lies."
"Servitude is not Slavery, its mandatory for women."
Women are multi-tasking; Men are not.
"Again, Married women should cook for their husbands, wash dirty dishes, clean their homes, lay their beds etc without murmuring."
"To sum it all, we urge all women to be submissive to all men around them to enhance quality lives and harmony for all as we age."
"Economics remains dominated by men, both in terms of faculty members and students."
"New research suggests that while economics textbooks aren't necessarily to blame, they're not helping close the field's gender gap."
"A study of leading introductory economics textbooks, presented last week at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, found that three-quarters of the people mentioned in the books (77 percent), real or imagined, are male."
"The real-life economists mentioned tend to be men, but not because they're key historical figures, according to the study."
"When these textbooks do mention women in relation to economic principles, they're more passive than their male counterparts and more likely to be involved in food, fashion or household tasks."
Men are more likely to be appear in relation to business or policy.
"In any kind of teaching material that we're creating as instructors, we're using the body of knowledge we have about the world we've experienced -- and that means that teaching materials, almost by definition, are backward-looking, said the lead author, Betsey Stevenson, associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan."
"Reasonable people might disagree as to whether that's a good, bad or neutral proposition, Stevenson said."
"One study found that female economists write more readable papers than their male peers but take significantly longer to get published, for example."
"A separate paper found that the field has different standards for men and women when it comes to co-authorship, and that the standards favor men."
Stevenson said economics as a discipline needs to do more to understand why women aren't attracted to the field and why the field is not attracting women.
"As an example, she cited a recent study saying that a female role model intervention program in introductory economics courses had no impact on male students but significantly increased women's likelihood of expressing interest in majoring in economics and taking future courses in it."
No female economist appears in every book studied.
"Economists, historically, have tended to be men."
"But even when Stevenson and Zlotnick excluded all economists from their analysis, 70 percent of people mentioned were still men."
"Analyzing only examples of ordinary, made-up people -- where textbook authors have the most creative leeway -- 59 percent of gendered examples were male."
The rest were women.
Few female business leaders are mentioned -- just 11 across seven books.
Six percent of policy makers listed in the books are female.
"Worldwide, just 4 percent of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women, Mankiw wrote."
"Historically, only one woman has been a member of this group."
"To be sure, he said, the role of women in society is changing, and in some circles there is some bias."
Textbooks still underrepresent women as CEOs.
So part of that decision-making process can also be about engaging women with meaningful examples and role models.
"Gender bias in science is not self-correcting and won't be tackled until women call it out, a Sydney geoscientist has warned."
"Writing this morning in the journal Nature, Macquarie University lecturer Shari Gallop says unfair treatment is rife in her field throughout the world."
"Many women face the same daily manifestations of gender bias, such as being ignored in favour of male colleagues, receiving fewer invitations to write grants or having fewer opportunities to participate in field work after becoming parents."
"Not surprisingly, many women have chosen to leave the discipline."
"Although a couple of close collaborators in my field are women, I'm probably unusual in that respect."
"I cannot think of one woman in my immediate research area who is a professor, or older than about 50."
"Dr Gallop has co-founded an international network, Women in Coastal Geoscience and Engineering, which was launched early last year."
"It runs conference events to raise awareness of gender bias, and has conferred an award for best paper led by a woman."
"That means checking for gender equality in everything from conference committees and keynote speaker lists to journal editorial boards, expert panels (and) peer reviewers for manuscripts and grants."
"We also need to be alert to gender disparity in our own projects, papers and grant applications, and in lists of suggested reviewers when we submit a paper."
"A lawsuit claiming Google systematically discriminates against women in pay and promotion could force the search giant, and other Silicon Valley companies, to change hiring and promotion practices."
"Three former Google employees filed the lawsuit Thursday in San Francisco, and said they would seek to make the case a class action, representing all women who have worked at Google since 2013."
"William Gould, a former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board who teaches law at Stanford, says the case could prompt changes at Google and elsewhere, such as opening up more avenues for promotion for women."
Google is also the subject of a US Department of Labor investigation into whether it discriminates against women in pay.
"Preliminary analyses showed large gaps; in addition, the New York Times last week reported that data compiled by female Google employees shows women are paid less than men in most job categories."
"It comes amid widespread concern about treatment of women in the technology industry, following public allegations of harassment against prominent executives and venture capitalists."
Thursday's complaint alleges that Google violated the California Equal Pay Act and engaged in unlawful and unfair business practices.
"It alleges that women are paid less than similarly qualified men, are assigned to lower job classifications, and placed on career ladders with lower pay and less prestige than comparable men."
"According to the complaint, she arrived at Google with four years experience but was placed in an entry-level ladder, and assigned a less-prestigious position."
The complaint claims that Ellis was paid less than men for substantially equal or similar work during her tenure at Google.
"In April, Google published a blog post insisting that Google was committed to pay equity, but did not find any gender pay gap after copious research."
It was both taboo and daunting to reveal that she was on the same level as a man with no work experience.
"There's no official way to appeal that and I didn't really see women talking about these issues as a systemic thing, she says."
"Pease had more than a decade of experience as a network engineer when she was hired, but was placed on the Business Systems ladder at Google, which came with lower compensation and fewer opportunities for upward mobility."
"Wisuri alleges that the most of her co-workers on the Sales ladder were men, but half the employees on the Sales Enablement ladder were women."
"She left the company in 2015 due to the lack of advancement opportunities for women, the complaint says."
"Kim Scott, a former Google executive who managed a team of 700 people during her six-year tenure at the company, says she did not experience or see any evidence of pay discrimination."
"Scott, who left Google in 2010, does not believe this will impact the company's ability to hire women."
"Google has a deserved reputation as being one of the best places for women to work, she says."
"Google is not perfect, but it's the best and I didn't have trouble there as a woman and I have had trouble at a lot of other places as a woman."
"A doctor, it said “ a feminist doctor “ had made a decision to revolutionise the national [US] spirits industry for the female consumer."
"Being a woman in the spirits industry, I am privy to its shortfalls in terms of gender equality from a profusion of whisky marketing campaigns that quite clearly single out men as their target drinker, to the often unaddressed issue of sexual harassment in the on-trade, a lack of women in key production roles, and the number of times a condescending voice suggested I add water to my whisky as it's a little strong, leaving my male peers to happily and autonomously make their own dilution decisions."
My enthusiasm quickly waned the revolutionary tool that was said to have the ability to bring about a fourth wave of feminism in the spirits industry was revealed to be a botanical gin liqueur.
"Indeed, a botanical gin liqueur whose floral marketing imagery challenges that of Laura Ashley and whose aromatic ingredients offer a solution to the fact that many women find traditional gin to be too bitter and/or verdant."
"The product, called Pomp & Whimsy, took the concept of gin and made it truer to us [women] and our palates."
Cultural and social factors provide better arguments for why men and women might be seen to largely enjoy different tastes.
"Sure, Pomp & Whimsy has a USP and could be seen as an attractive product by many women, but it also ostracises potential new consumers in this case, men, a significant number of whom will certainly have an aversion to bitter or challenging flavours."
Creating a female-centred sub-section of spirits is just a bad as excluding them entirely from traditionally male-dominated categories.
Should women be considered more in spirits marketing?
"But this felt like a cheap marketing ploy, and perhaps a missed opportunity to further the conversation about the real needs and representations of female spirits drinkers."
Men are tough; women are in touch with their feelings.
Men are providers; women are nurturers.
Men should punch back when provoked; women should be physically attractive.
"Even in an era of transgender rights, a surge of women running for office and a rising number of stay-at-home fathers, most Americans believe men and women are fundamentally different, and that masculinity is more valued than femininity."
"The workplace is the one area in which a majority of men and women said the sexes were more alike than different in terms of what they were good at: 63 percent of respondents said men and women excelled at the same things at work, while 37 percent said they were good at different things."
"Nearly half of men, and 57 percent of men ages 18 to 36, said they felt pressure to join in when other men talked about women in a sexual way."
Only a man could do his job because it is so difficult.
"Qatar Airways has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position."
"Al Baker's comments came the day it was announced that he was commencing a one-year term as chairman of the IATA Board of Governors, succeeding Goh Choon Phong, the CEO of Singapore Airlines."
"The huge costs of depriving women and girls of rights and opportunities are borne not only by women and girls themselves, but also by their families, communities, and the entire economy."
"By investing in women and girls and ending gender inequality, we can eliminate those costs and change the fate of entire countries."
There is no doubt that ensuring that women and girls enjoy the same rights and opportunities as men and boys is the right thing to do from a moral and ethical standpoint.
Countries benefit from an increase in wealth for women.
"A new report released by the World Bank Group, with support from the Canadian government, finds that if women had the same lifetime earnings as men, global wealth would increase by $23,620 per person, on average, in the 141 countries studied, for a total of $160 trillion."
"Despite this clear opportunity, women still only account for 38% of their countries' human capital wealth, defined as the value of the future earnings of adult citizens."
"In poor and lower-middle-income countries, women account for just one-third of such wealth or even less."
"In nearly every country, women and girls face systemic barriers that bar them from full and equal participation in the workforce and the formal economy more broadly."
"While the specific challenges confronting women vary, the fundamental imperative is the same everywhere: national governments and international actors must put the needs and priorities of women and girls at the center of everything they do."
"As the current head of the G7, Canada has committed to ensuring that gender equality and women's empowerment are integrated into all of the body's themes, activities, and initiatives."
"This approach echoes Canada's Feminist International Assistance Policy, launched last year on the premise that ensuring equal rights and economic opportunities for women and girls is the best way to eradicate poverty."
"If women are to participate equally in the labor force, we first need to ensure that they have the right tools."
"That means guaranteeing that all women and girls have access to health care and information, proper nutrition, and safe and effective learning environments at all levels."
"It also means upholding sexual and reproductive rights and combating sexual and gender-based violence, including harmful practices like child, early, or forced marriage."
That is not enough to improve women's employment opportunities and earnings.
"We must also take collective action to reduce the amount of time women spend in unpaid work; to ensure they have access to and control over productive assets like land, credit, insurance, and savings; and to address the restrictive social norms that relegate women to lower-paid or informal work."
Policies to support women's entrepreneurship would also have far-reaching benefits.
"One initiative that is already advancing this goal is the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi), a collaborative partnership housed at the World Bank and supported by 14 governments, including Canada."
We-Fi seeks to unlock billions of dollars in financing for women-owned or women-led businesses in developing countries.
"Moreover, by considering economic empowerment in terms of gender, we may better understand how intersecting issues like ethnicity, age, disability, or language also create barriers to full and equal economic participation."
The CEO of Qatar Airways has been verbally grounded by critics angry with his recent statement that airlines must be led by men because it is a very challenging position.
"Al-Baker is the new chairman of the board of governors of IATA, where only six of its 280 members have female chief executives, BBC reports."
"Discussing gender inequality within the male-dominated aviation industry at the event, held this week in Sydney."
"He went on to point out that women comprise 44 percent of the Qatar Airways workforce, describing the carrier as a ""pioneer"" in the region through its commitment to gender equality in the workplace."
"From being the first carrier to employ female pilots to promoting female engineers and senior vice president positions, he mused that Qatar Airways is made stronger by its female employees for whom I hold in nothing but the highest regard."
"In June 2015, Qatar Airways was called out for a policy that barred flight crew from getting married or pregnant, Reuters reported."
"After giving birth, the vast majority of educated women never catch up to their husbands in earning power."
"According to a recent paper from the US Census Bureau, women who have children either very early or very late are less affected by the wage gap, whereas those who have them between the ages of 25 and 35 (that is, the vast majority of educated working women) are hit hardest."
"Researchers think that this is because, when it comes to combining work and family, women who have kids at a later stage in their careers (35 to 45) are better able to reap the benefits of all those years of hard work."
"Throughout my late 20s and early 30s, I watched many girlfriends find partners, have children and subsequently struggle to reconcile their youthful career ambitions with the rigours of family life."
"While I was grinding it out at the office, putting in long hours and frankly focusing on work as a distraction from my (admittedly rather haphazard) romantic life, these girlfriends were making tough decisions about what actually truly mattered to them, given that there were only a finite number of hours in the day."
"While I focused all my energy on work (it was either that or sit in my apartment and cry about boys who just weren't ready to commit), I watched dozens of more grown-up girlfriends struggle with how to get what they wanted out of their careers and give their babies the love and attention they needed."
"The majority of these women ended up opting for some sort of compromise: part-time work, job sharing, flex hours, fledgling entrepreneurship."
"Now that I'm in my 40s, I can count the number of mothers I know who earn the same as or more than their male spouses on one hand."
Never for a moment did I consider giving up my work or slowing down the pace once I had kidsâ€”I'd spent too long building my freelance career.
"Interestingly, the pay gap age window holds true across almost all Western nations from the US, where many professional women have no paid leave, to Sweden, where all mothers are entitled to 18 months of paid leave (and a high proportion of men take paternity leave, too)."
"I'm not making the argument that mothers should cut their maternity leaves short or eschew part-time, flexible working situations; what I'm saying is that there is a trade-off here."
"According to Tanya van Biesen, executive director of Catalyst Canada, an organization that promotes women's rights in the workplace, these include (but are not limited to) women starting at lower wages than men in their first jobs (which then get magnified over time), a persistent unconscious bias in talent management and compensation systems, a lack of access to affordable childcare (pulling and keeping women out of the workforce), additional pressures placed on women to be the one responsible for family care, uneven (or, in some cases, non-existent) parental leave benefits and a lack of access for women to senior-level sponsors in organizations (leaders who are advocating for their development and advancement)."
The more workable solution is for fathers to step up and start doing their fair share of housework and parenting.
"At present, women do the lion's share of â€œhome care,â€ even when we earn the same or more than our spouses."
It actually comes down to dads.
"The more dads who step up and muck in, the narrower the wage gap will be."
Women are less likely to serve as mayors.
"In a new paper published in the June issue of the Canadian Journal of Political Science, Thomas closely examined the ascendance of the eight women who have served as provincial premiers in Canada since 1991 (there were 50 men over the same timeframe, excluding anyone who served in an interim capacity)."
"She chose that role because Canada has had a sudden boon of female premiers in recent years, and it's a powerful office with responsibility for major programs including healthcare, education and child care."
"But, she argues, women are also savvy observers."
"A party in decline, meanwhile, was one suffering a slow and appreciable erosion in support, which had to be clear before the party selected a female leader."
"My goal was to see if I could find really clear evidence that the parties were losing support and knew it before these women were selected,she says."
"Of the eight female premiers Thomas assessed, two were selected to lead parties obviously in crisis."
"Rita Johnston became British Columbia's premier and Canada's first female premier in 1991 at the helm of the Social Credit party, after Bill Vander Zalm resigned amid conflict of interest accusations about mixing his public office with his private business interests."
"She became Quebec premier after her party won a general election in 2012, but they were out of power and destroyed at the polls less than two years later."
So her leadership contest is super-consistent with women's leadership selection patterns for parties in Canada.
Her path would also follow the more typical male script.
Four of these women weren't taking over weak parties.
"Some of her colleagues have found that female leaders have shorter tenures than men, especially when their parties are electorally competitive"
She would like to see more research on the circumstances of women's exits from politics.
They push women harder and faster than they do men.
"Men are given the privilege of being able to choose when they want to leave, Thomas says."
"To argue that women get a shot as leaders only when parties are in crisis or decline gives people a pass on how they judge women by harsher standards and how sexism comes into play once they start exercising power, Thomas argues."
I'd like to see a world where women just seek leadership in the same way that men do.
"In a convention hall in downtown Ottawa, five influential conservative women are on stage, talking about feminism."
"It's the first time this topic has been addressed in any formal way at the Manning Networking Conference, an annual gathering of conservative politicos and policy wonks from across the country, now in its 10th year."
"Up until then, I was celebrated as a champion of women and a feminist in this country."
"One of his first moves in office was to install a cabinet of 50 percent women, the first gender-parity cabinet in Canadian history."
"Within weeks of his election, Trudeau had become a spokesperson for women's empowerment, and, to the rest of the world, his stance "" to be a feminist is to be pro-choice, pro-quota and pro-leaning-in ” became Canada's stance."
"All of a sudden, it was as though the prime minister had a monopoly on caring about women's welfare."
"Women who previously self-identified as feminists, many of whom had spent their careers advocating for women, found themselves recast in relation to this one man, Justin Trudeau."
"Trudeau's Liberals kept the volume turned up on gender issues (announcing, for example, that budgets would be informed by a gender-based analysis) and held fast to their principles, especially on the issue of reproductive rights."
"Last year, they blocked Conservative women's critic Rachael Harder from becoming chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women because of her anti-abortion leanings; more recently, they stood behind a policy to disqualify organizations from the summer jobs program if they didn't hold a pro-choice position."
"Up on stage, Raitt tells the audience she was raised to be a feminist in Cape Breton with the assurance that she could succeed at anything."
"She grew up to become a lawyer, then the first woman harbourmaster of a Canadian port, then CEO of the Toronto Port Authority, working in rooms populated mainly by men and never making her gender an issue."
"If Conservative women and men want to stand up and talk about women's right to equal pay, they're welcome to."
Trudeau's reputation as feminist-in-chief is not necessarily enough to reliably shore up support among women voters.
"In the last federal election, the Liberals handily won all female age groups â€” by an overall margin of 17 points, according to Abacus Data, with 42 percent of women voting for Liberals and 25 percent voting Conservative."
"But a March 2018 Forum Research poll saw that gap narrow significantly, with only 37 percent of women saying they would vote Liberal if an election were held this spring, compared with 30 percent saying they would cast a ballot for the Conservatives."
"Harder, an Alberta MP, says she thinks Trudeau's full-frontal feminist stand is shutting down discourse, dividing women and preventing rigorous debate."
"It's the age-old debate about feminism, writ large in Canadian politics: What makes you a feminist, who is feminism for, and who gets to decide?"
"With the Liberals having staked such a massive claim on women's issues, is it even possible to be a Conservative and a feminist in Trudeau's Canada?"
"Trudeau's election dovetailed with a global surge in progressive, inclusive, social-media-driven feminism."
"His credibility on this front was in place long before Donald Trump's election as the U.S. president triggered the women's marches (an event that, to many Conservative women, felt like a purposeless parade of identity politics that excluded entire swaths of the population)."
"Like many progressive feminists, Trudeau starts from the position that women have been subject to systemic barriers that need dismantling to level the playing field â€” which has garnered him praise from world leaders and global activists, including global girls' education advocate Malala Yousafzai and billionaire philanthropist Melinda Gates, who are both part of Canada's gender-equality council for the G7."
"But Trudeau's gender-quota cabinet, long a bugbear for the Conservatives, continues to rankle for how it places more value on parity than on experience."
Raitt needled Finance Minister Bill Morneau over whether the GBA was just a ploy to attract women voters.
He responded that Canada will be more successful collectively if there are more women in leadership roles.
It's not necessarily the Liberals' attention to feminism that bothers Conservative women; it's the approach.
"Michelle Rempel, one of the Conservative Party's most vocal and visible feminists, describes it as â€œdogmaticâ€ â€” presented as unquestionable and unchallengeable in its rightness."
"I think that's where my voice and other conservatives in Canada have an important role to play in terms of advancing gender parity, is in questioning some of the dogma in policy on the left,â€ said the immigration, refugees and citizenship critic, in a video posted to her YouTube channel on International Women's Day in March."
She sees a danger in the way she feels the Trudeau government treats liberal feminism and its inextricable ties to his personal brand.
"It implies that there's a certain homogeneity to women, and we know that's not the case, she elaborated in an interview."
Many conservatives believe in more of a show-don't-tell approach to feminism.
"Women have the ability to earn their positions, the Raitts and Rempels say, without quotas and special rules."
"A lot of conservatives subscribe to choice feminism, says Kelly Gordon, an assistant professor of political science at McGill University, who has studied feminism and conservative politics."
"There's an increasing willingness [on the right] to identify as a feminist, but the meaning of that feminism is very contested."
"For example, can Conservative leader Andrew Scheer choose to identify as a feminist (as he did in this 2017 Chatelaine interview) but be personally pro-life and unwilling to lend the support of his office to a pride parade?"
"The message, she says, seems to be that the Liberals care about women and will make decisions in their best interests."
She feels conservatives have historically embraced an approach to feminism that is much harder to draw a box around.
She has also been one of the most vocal advocates calling for meaningful action to end sexual harassment and misconduct in Ottawa.
"Liberals are trying to say that Conservatives can't be feminists, she says."
I think where they get frustrated is when I stand up in the House of Commons and [share] a very feminist perspective.
She worries about feminism becoming a purely partisan issue.
"Where was all this concern over women during the Stephen Harper years, when funding to Status of Women Canada (which promotes equality and economic opportunities for women) was slashed, health services were defunded and there was no plan for addressing equal pay?"
"If feminism is a football, then to Hajdu, this recent forceful opposition probably seems like a political Hail Mary."
"â€œIt could be something [Conservatives] just have to do,â€ she says."
"Rachael Harder's eyes well up a little when she thinks back to last October, when she was voted down as chair of the status of women committee, which she'd served on since shortly after becoming the first woman Conservative MP for the Alberta riding of Lethbridge in 2015."
That history worked against her when her nomination by fellow Conservatives for the chair came up last fall.
"Liberal and NDP members walked out of the meeting and then, one by one, voted her down during the chair selection process."
She says she has proven her openness to listening and a desire to understand women and their perspective on different political issues that impact their daily lives.
Vecchio had nominated Harder in the first place and said explicitly that she did not want the job.
"The line feels well practised with Harder, who gets asked about this all the time."
But that perceived silencing feels familiar to other conservative women in the pro-life camp.
"Twenty-one-year-old Lia Mills, who is involved in the political arm of Canada's anti-abortion movement, which urges MPs to introduce some kind of law that will see a fetus afforded human rights, took a women's studies class in university to learn more about feminism."
"Mills, who was at the Manning conference in February, has been an identifiable activist on this issue since a video of her speaking out against abortion at age 12 (filmed for a class project in 2009) went viral."
"â€œI genuinely believe that there is great potential for cooperation,â€ says Mills."
â€œI don't think [feminists and pro-lifers] should be mutually exclusive groups â€” I think we have a lot of common groundâ€.
She has spoken with women who've had abortions who don't want to see that right be taken away but who agree that more should be done to address situations that may lead a woman to pursue an abortion in the first place.
"In her mind, despite their rather enormous, unresolvable differences, some of their priorities are the same."
"There have, of course, been those rare moments in politics when both Liberals and Conservatives have seen eye to eye on issues that impact women."
"For instance, Bill C-65, designed to strengthen protections against sexual harassment for political staffers, was supported by all parties and is now at the Senate."
"But Harder says she knows of women MPs from all parties who disagree with Trudeau's position on quotas, his pro-choice policies and his emphasis on getting more women into full-time jobs."
She wanted to speak up on social media when Harder was blocked from becoming the chair of the status of women committee.
"People have the right to share their opinions, and women should totally speak up on this issue, she says."
I think there's totally a double standard for conservative women.
"If we even raise [an alternative perspective], immediately it's like we want all women pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen."
"On some level, it should be welcomed, to add to the vast diversity of viewpoints on feminism, but they shouldn't be surprised by pushback,she says, speaking specifically on rights to abortion access."
"Yes, the session was held in response to Trudeau's sunny feminism but also to the reinvention that Conservatives have been tasked with out of necessity, after losing their majority government in 2015."
"The number one issue, male or female, is how unaffordable life is right now, says Raitt."
"She chewed tobacco, did finger pull ups and swore with gusto."
"Jan Redford was a rock climber in the 1980s, long before women were commonplace in that community."
"After a heartbreaking loss, she found herself married to a logger and pregnant, struggling to maintain her dream of a less conventional life."
"In the 1980s, it was early days for women rock climbers."
"There was a lot of unintended, well-meaning sexism."
"For example, men talked about taking me climbing, not just going climbing."
They didn't take other guys climbing.
They took me under their wing and thought it was cute when I wanted to be the lead climber.
I was definitely the poster child for The Cinderella Complex.
"So, I felt like a bad feminist because I had that conflict, as opposed to just living with the conflict and acknowledging I had conflict and accepting and understanding it."
Did that change the Cinderella Complex symptoms?
I'd become afraid of throwing myself into a man's orbit (again) and whittling myself down.
Female climbers were in high demand as girlfriends.
"In the middle of first semester, I [accidentally] got pregnant and subsequently married Grant, just before he took himself off to climb Nanga Parbat in Pakistan."
"I got a job, while pregnant a second time, as a silviculture technician with the Ministry of Forests."
"How did that go, being a working mom in a logging town?"
And he didn't want me to finish my degree in Calgary.
What kind of woman lets a stranger raise her children?
I went easy on him!
"People who knew us, including my daughter, think I was very kind to him in the book."
"It's odd, I don't think he actually believes women belong in the kitchen, but he didn't want his own lifestyle as a climber interrupted by the children."
He doesn't have any traditional expectations of our daughter.
"In fact, he's very proud of her."
"Jenna thinks her father will not mind his portrayal in the book, but I disagree."
He's not going to be happy with it.
You went back to university in your 30s and moved into student housing with two young kids.
"My son, Sam, was young, but Jenna saw me struggle on my own because I made this choice to go back to school."
"She didn't see me become Gloria Steinem, but she saw me take control of my life."
I wouldn't understand climbing at all if it took my daughter away from me.
She's a very good climber and a very different person.
She doesn't hurl herself off cliffs and hope she grows wings.
She's smarter than I was on the rock.
"Because there's such a strong feminist theme throughout the book, tell me your thoughts about the MeToo movement."
They don't feel it's acceptable.
"In the climbing community, I felt like I couldn't say too much because I didn't want the guys to think I didn't have a sense of humour and I wanted to be one of the guys."
Women today limit themselves less than we [Boomers] did.
"Whereas young women today grew up with more freedom and believe they have the right to that freedom, but society is still trying to keep them down with the high cost of daycare, student loans, pay disparity."
I have personally been pressured to behave and dress in more traditionally feminine ways by my mother and sisters.
"This often goes against my nerdy, tomboyish nature, especially since I do not enjoy wearing things like earrings, high-heels, (most) bright colors, or frilly clothes - the types of things that are equated to femininity."
"I also do not often act as elegant or passive as my mother would prefer, but rather I am generally blunt, cynical, awkward, and geeky."
These characteristics do not really fall under the clear-cut generalizations for females; they are somewhere in between male and female characteristics.
Many people still stick to traditional ideas that men and women should behave in ways that fall into specific categories determined solely on their gender.
"However, male or female gender-specific identities are irrelevant in modern, civilized society."
"Nevertheless, in many of the modern societies today, there is no need for traditional gender roles, because both men and women are able to do many of the same necessary tasks, thereby making gender-specific behaviors irrelevant."
"Therefore, it is critical that we encourage everyone to follow and express their own truth, regardless of gender norms, so that everyone is able contribute fully to our society."
Many of the gender stereotypes we know today were not always present in the past; they are relatively new trends in human society.
"Bobolts describes how gender stereotypes, such as the color blue being for boys and the color pink being for girls, are new concepts."
"She explains that between the years 1918 and 1940, pink was viewed as a masculine color, while blue was seen dainty and soft, making it best suited for females."
"Bobolts also states that during the Middle Ages in Europe, high-heels were exclusively for men, rather than women."
"Furthermore, based on an article published by Pennsylvania State University, many gender roles around the world were dictated by the environment and the needs of a society."
"For example, in many old Native American and African tribes, cultures were matriarchal, meaning that women were often leaders, healers, and important figures in their communities."
"This is different from most Asian and European societies, where men were the only ones with any social or political power."
"Therefore, depending on the time period or region, gender roles vary drastically."
"Since these typecasts based on sex are different depending on where and when they are used, they clearly hold no real significance to human society as a whole in this modern age; they were made up and therefore can change."
"As a result, they should not be used as a guideline as to how people of a certain sex should behave, because they are not reliable nor constant."
"Although many people seem to fit within the specific categories of masculinity or femininity, these generalizations are simple social constructs."
"For instance, during the Paleolithic Era and early Neolithic Era, during which most societies were nomadic tribal units, men hunted animals for sources of meat, skins, and bones, while women scavenged for roots, nuts, and berries, as well as looked after the children."
"Over time, the technological and agricultural developments of the Neolithic Revolution spread, causing more nomadic tribes to settle down into stationary lifestyles."
"Thus, women began to stay home or within the settlement to take care of children, make clothes, and other domestic tasks, while men worked the fields to grow food, domesticate animals, and continue to hunt, although to a lesser scale."
"While children and women did tend to the fields with the men, they were often not as physically capable as the men, and thus began to be valued as less."
"Therefore, gender should not be confined to the sex of an individual, because gender is not actually a biological occurrence."
"Based on a survey done on Debate.org, some people believe that gender-specific expectations are necessary because each gender has jobs they fulfill in society; they â€œare necessary for society to function naturallyâ€."
"Girls act girly because it's innate, and that gender programming [by society] has nothing to do with it."
"This view by conservatives often allows them to enforce their belief that women should do domestic work, as well as other feminine things because it is natural to them (Miesser)."
"Adam was created first, and was viewed as the leader who guided the world, while Eve was his helper."
The Bible also specifies the authority of men over their wife (or wives) and daughters.
"For instance, when Eve eats the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the book of Genesis, her first sin was stated to not be eating the fruit, but was leaving the area of Adam's authority."
"However, just as high heels were once exclusively worn by men in the Middle Ages, and pink was a masculine color, these views are outdated, being largely rooted in the eras from which they are based."
"Despite the reasons that people who still believe in the relevance of gender roles present, there is a lot of evidence that contradicts them."
"For those that believe that gender roles are innate and occur naturally, it has been observed that gender roles develop as a person grows up."
The Local sat down with her for a short chat.
I tried to make the point that Sweden is implementing gender equality level 2.
We already have quite a lot of programmes where Sweden is helping Ukraine in supporting gender reform and working against the discrimination of women.
We have also been assessing how the situation has changed in terms of the role of women in the military and security and defence fields over these last years.
It started as women volunteers helping to provide necessary goods for the Armed Forces.
"Two years ago we opened up quite a few military professions for women and now we have almost 25,000 women serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is a big number."
"It used to be medics and cooks, but they are serving as artillerists, intelligence officers and so on, and that opens up a totally new perspective: how do men perceive women officers?"
"So therefore all these economic arguments resonate not only with women, but also with men."
Sweden is a very good example for how you progress and benefit as a society and economy if you have equal opportunities for men and women.
So therefore Sweden's feminist foreign policy has a very good basis that allows people to deeply think about the things that could be done in other parts of the world.
"You're a woman in a senior position, have you ever felt it was hard to get ahead?"
"Now, don't be misled, I represent a government with gender equality priorities, but I am among three women out of 25 people on the government."
"Ukraine today has the highest number of women in parliament that it has ever had, but that is just 12 percent."
"So I think all of us who have made it this far take it as a very serious responsibility that we do not screw up, that we are professional, active, engaged enough so that we pave the way for others who come behind us."
I think unfortunately most of us in the country have had this or that negative experience because of being a woman.
You still hear sexist language and stereotypes even in the political debate and that should not be acceptable.
"But finally we are raising our voices, not just women but also men, and that is a huge transformation we have not seen before."
Nothing can protect women from the random acts of violence committed by some men but engaging with the stories of women and girls is crucial for making cities safer.
"Planners, architects, the police and politicians need to put aside the traditional expert perspective to learn from and design for women's experiences."
Women have also provided anonymous descriptions about a particular incident and the urban context in which it occurred.
"The web app has mapped over 4,000 reports from young women in Australia and is conducting research globally on this ubiquitous social issue."
With around 80% of sexual harassment and assault never reported the primary task is to gather the harrowing stories of women and girls and produce the statistics that will agitate for action.
"For instance, we have found that the incidents of sexual harassment in public transport spaces makes many women limit their movement through cities."
City parks and public parklands is another hotspot and captures the complexity of women and girl's engagement in urban recreational spaces.
"Most people are great but have had three instances of being followed by non-jogging men and sometimes men sit in cars watching runners at certain car parks (Botanic Gardens, Melbourne)."
A man chased me with a broken glass bottle as I was walking through the park one afternoon.
"Late night may be vulnerable times for women, unsafe experiences can happen at any time and actually happen all the time."
The enduring impact on women is that they change their behaviour and enlist hyper-vigilant safekeeping strategies.
Designing for women Gender mainstreaming is a term used in urban design when access to city spaces must benefit all genders equally.
"By listening to women and asking questions about their needs, gender mainstreaming has recognised the impact design has on women's sense of safety."
"While Australia has guidelines for city planners for safer parks, the stories of the women above show these aren't enough."
"In one project, planners observed a relationship between the dominance of play facilities aimed at boys and male teens in parks, and the withdrawal of girls from parks around 10-13 years of age."
"By including local girls in design workshops, the subsequent re-designed park increased girls' participation through girls-only retreat spaces, non-male sport and play areas and calm zones for socialisation."
"Engaging women and girls from all sectors of the community as co-designers, is crucial for gender-sensitive cities."
"Women represent enormous diversity defined by their cultural background, socioeconomic status, where they live, their sexuality, dis/ability and age."
"To design for women is to be inclusive of all women and girls, including cis-women, trans-women and intersex women."
Women and girls' stories are desperately needed right now.
Urban spaces reflect our shared social values and the crisis of sexual violence against women in public spaces must propel the transformation of our cities.
"Perhaps more pointedly, how to explain why so many men who treat women badly get away with it?"
"A man who physically terrorized two of his now-ex wives is protected by the White House, then vocally defended by the president."
"All over the country, there are men who support and admire women for their accomplishments outside the home, and men who are co-parenting with their wives, girlfriends, and exes."
"Working class fathers actually spend more time with their kids than do professional men, as Joan Williams of the Hastings College of Law Center for Worklife Law and her colleagues have found."
"The corollary to the relative silence about men who nurture, love, read bedtime stories, and endure recorder recitals is how rare it is to see a man publicly and unambivalently brag about his wife's professional accomplishments."
"In the public sphere, we hear men brag about their wives' beauty or express gratitude for their wives' dedication to home and family."
We sometimes see fathers beaming with pride over their daughters' accomplishments or grown sons thanking their single mothers for earning a living while parenting solo.
"But a man's authentic expression of admiration and regard for his wife's career or intellect, along with an acknowledgement, implicit or explicit, of his own family commitments, still seems painfully rare in the public discourse."
A man's authentic expression of admiration and regard for his wife's career or intellect still seems painfully rare in the public discourse.
"Chris Hayes spoke about how much the insights of his wife, Cardozo Law Professor Kate Shaw, enrich and inform his own reporting and commentary on the Constitution and the law, and he invited her on his podcast so that the rest of us could learn from her."
Each man described his wife's intelligence and professional accomplishments with enormous pride and admiration.
Each man voiced his commitment to a family partnership.
Neither man suggested or implied that his own career was made possible by his wife's taking care of the home and family so he did not have to.
Are they taking their cues from the Hollywood men who perform happy marriages while behaving like predators?
"There is evidence, for example, that when fathers regularly do housework, their daughters are more likely to feel free to ambitiously pursue careers."
They have seen their moms and dads prioritize their partners' careers and ambitions.
"Put this kind of zero-sum thinking together with the widespread discussion of mistreatment of women at the hands of men and you have a toxic recipe for how men and women relate to each other, from the workplace to the public square to the most intimate family relationships."
"Female success is the cause of male failure, and male violence and male backlash."
"Perhaps, this is one way in which the record number of female candidates running for office could have an impact separate and apart from their electoral success."
Images of husbands cheering on their wives are much more common.
This would be a remarkable Father's Day gift to your children and your wives.
"In 2018, that these fathers are showing their sons every day that cheering on the women in their lives is simply what smart and confident men do."
"While most people realize that stereotypes are untrue, many still make assumptions based on gender."
"There are many stereotypes we may all be guilty of, such as assuming that all women want to marry and have children, or that all men love sports."
"As soon as we find out it's a girl, we immediately begin decorating a pink nursery filled with soft décor and butterflies and flowers."
"What this is essentially doing, even though many parents don't realize it, is setting our child up to be the perfect lady, and teaching her how to be the stereotypical woman."
"Even as young as five or six, she is well aware that she is supposed to stay home with the baby while the husband goes to work, and she has dinner ready when he gets home."
Here is another stereotype; women stay at home while men go to work.
"While there are a million gender stereotypes about females, these are definitely the biggest, and the most debated by feminists of today."
"The nursery is decked out in blue, his closet is filled with tiny jeans, polo shirts, and boots, and the theme is usually something like jungle animals or dinosaurs; something tough."
"Boys' toys consist of trucks, dinosaurs, action figures, and video games."
"From the beginning boys are taught to be tough, to be protective, and to defend themselves."
"Boys are taught that daddy's go to work and mommy's stay at home; from their point of view, boys have fun and girls do all the work."
Are you surprised to hear that most parents admit that they do not teach their sons how to do chores such as washing dishes or folding laundry?
"Instead, they teach them to take out the trash and mow the lawn; from the get-go boys are made to think that certain household chores are women's work."
"Men are supposed to do the dirty jobs and anything that requires muscle, they are also supposed to go to work and provide for the family."
"Men are not nurses, they are doctors ."
All men enjoy working on cars.
Each person is an individual and it is perfectly normal for a woman to run her own business while a man stays home with the kids.
"On the other hand it is also perfectly acceptable for a man to be a nurse or hate sports, or enjoy cooking."
Men and women are individuals; they are more than just male or female.
"The Harvard Business School has been following their alumnae over the years, and have found that female graduates' ambitions are taking a back seat to men's."
"But, for female graduates, their aspirations fell short if they stopped to settle down and have a family."
"Only a quarter of female graduates between the ages of 26 to 31 said they would allow their husbands' careers to take priority over their own, while 50 percent of men claimed their careers would take precedence over their wives'."
The surveys seem to reveal a majority of men still hold more traditional views of family life.
"Women, however, had a more progressive outlook, as 42 percent expected to do most of the child-rearing."
"If surveys from older graduates are any indication, the women may end up shifting their goals in order to be more in-line with their husbands'."
"However, the researchers indicate that, compared to older generations, Millennial men are less expectant for their careers to take priority."
A third of male graduates also expected to split child care 50/50 compare that to 22 percent of Gen X men and 16 percent of Baby Boomers.
"However, in the workplace, these older generations still rule the roost, where there may be different notions of what work-life balance means for female Millennials."
One 30-year-old alumnae confessed to researchers: have thought about going to interviews without my [wedding and engagement] rings on so that an interviewer doesn't get a preconceived notion of my dedication based upon where I might be in my life stage.
"Many of the new attendees were women who came to meet Rachel Morrison, the 39-year-old cinematographer of Mudbound and Black Panther, according to Kees Van Oostrum, the president of the ASC."
"Weeks earlier, Morrison had become the first woman ever nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography for her work on Mudbound, Netflix's historical race drama."
So many young women who either hoped to be cinematographers or who were already working in the profession just wanted to meet Rachel.
She's had this incredible effect on showing people a goal is reachable.
"For years, women have been shut out of having that influence."
"Men vastly dominate its ranks, meaning that movies have been quite literally subject to the male gaze in a way audience members may not even be aware."
"The percentage of female cinematographers on the box office top 250 sits at only 4 percent, the lowest of all the major film jobs, according to San Diego State University's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film."
"By contrast, female representation among directors is 11 percent, and 25 percent among producers."
Cinematography straddles the line between the technical and the creative but its dearth of women is similar to other technical areas such as sound and visual effects with similarly low representation.
"Still, the cinematography number represents at least a small uptick: Female representation has doubled from 2 percent since 2013."
I hope we'll soon see a lot more women getting behind the camera.
"Membership in the ASC, which confers the cachet that attracts employers, has grown painfully slowly for women."
"The first woman joined in the 1980s more than 60 years after the group was founded and as of 2005, the group had only five women out of some 350 members."
Cinematography was the last Oscar category to never see a female nominee.
"""I'm realizing that I've become a role model and then that visibility is giving a lot of women the courage to keep going, or the courage to get started, or it feels like a light at the end of the tunnel,"" Morrison told The Washington Post last week."
"Still, she didn't win Sunday night."
The reasons cinematography is so overwhelmingly male run deep in Hollywood.
"Classes at films schools haven't historically gone out of their way to encourage female enrollees, Van Oostrum said, while the clubby nature of the sector has made it harder for women to break through out in the professional world."
I remember when people would say a camera was too heavy for women to lift.
"Studios have also run very few of the female- and minority-centric shadowing programs designed to encourage new talent in cinematography unlike directing, where such programs are common."
"The International Cinematographers Guild Local 600, the union that represents many craftspeople behind the camera, has only in the past few years started to increase its efforts to recruit women, with craft seminars and a negotiating session to help younger women stand their ground for equal pay."
That limits younger women's numbers in the ASC which in turn further prevents them from getting hired.
So someone doing the hiring just makes an assumption of capability for men and incapability for women.
"The rushed vote, and McCrory's late-night signature, essentially nullified that measure and prevented any other efforts to pass LGBT protections."
He also pledged to work with the state's LGBT community to press for the new law to be repealed.
All of my experiences with discrimination and gender bias are nuanced; every conversation adds a new layer.
"I'm a school psychologist, and have lived all over the US, but constantly run into ignorance in Utah, where I guess being a woman of color with a graduate degree and professional experience is exotic."
One time I went to a conference with my two male employees.
They introduced me to another man there who was from another organization so that I could tell him about some initiatives I was directing.
"When she gave input, he didn't listen at all."
"Currently, I'm getting underpaid by about $13,000 a year compared to a male coworker who has the same position, same credentials, and same experience as me."
Both new coworkers and clients automatically assume that she's an intern or someone's part-time assistant rather than a salaried employee with a grad degree.
I definitely recommend that black women try to look for jobs in environments where you see others who look like you.
"He got extremely offended, and said, 'How do you think it makes me feel that the most attractive girl in this bar doesn't like men?'"
My girlfriend had just started her new job.
"She's a bartender, and this creepy older dude kept hitting on her."
"When she finally told him that she was gay and that she had a girlfriend, he got extremely offended, and said, ""How do you think it makes me feel that the most attractive girl in this bar doesn't like men""?"
"""My height makes every guy think I can't possibly do things on my own"", said Sarah."
I laugh at the people who believe women can't do what men do easily.
"She laughs at the people who tell her to ""be careful not to break a nail""."
"I laugh at the people who clearly have no idea I'm a strong, independent woman, and I've got this."
"There are many ways for us to increase the diversity of our sources, and achieving gender parity is by far the simplest of them."
"After all, it is easy to guess someone's gender based on their name, and when tracking progress, there is an obvious 50 percent threshold to aim for."
"Gender parity is a start, not an end point."
"Another popular critique is that I should simply focus on finding the most qualified people for any given story, regardless of gender."
Am I to assume that these metrics somehow exist in a social vacuum and are not themselves also influenced by the very gender biases that I am trying to resist?
Note that this call to ignore gender and find the best sources almost always arises when journalists talk about including more female voices.
"Absent, because as Adrienne noted in her piece, this vein of criticism implicitly assumes that the best source is not a woman."
"It suggests that the status quo, in which men are overrepresented, is one in which the best sources are already being found."
"They had reputations, but they accrued those reputations in a world where women are systematically disadvantaged compared to men."
40-75% of people can't solve this riddle because they're unable to imagine the surgeon is a woman.
The surgeon is the boy's mother.
65-90% of men can't solve this riddle because they're unable to think about anything other than porn after reading the first sentence.
"Afterwards, she says she feels blessed because all she needs in life is to be with precious Pebbles."
100% of people who follow celebrity news cannot imagine a childless forty-something actress feeling blessed or fulfilled.
"Overall, Jennifer is perceived as less competent, is offered a lower salary, and is deemed to be more likely to mishandle a nerve agent and cause the death of thousands."
"Despite their purported objectivity, 70-85% of male biologists, chemists and physicists possess the same emotional maturity as Mr. Morris, your 8th grade Earth Science teacher who interrupted a lesson on metamorphic rocks to guess the bra sizes of the girls."
Her in-depth reporting on ordinary people facing poverty and hardship wins a prestigious human interest journalism award.
"One month later, she's turned down for the job of television news presenter."
The journalist is a woman over the age of 50 and do I really need to explain this one to you?
"Meanwhile, her colleague John is promoted."
John's wife had a baby and his staff threw him a surprise party with his favorite cream cheese topped carrot cake.
"93-95% of the staff gushed about how ""natural"" and ""gracious"" John was at the party."
The CEO felt he had no choice but to promote him.
"A male author is asked to write a review of three different war correspondent memoirs and lauds two of them, but describes this one as ""whiny"" and ""self-absorbed""."
"He also attributes its success to ""dumb luck""."
The male author had just asked a woman out on a date and felt assured of receiving a positive response since she was 10-15% older than his usual companions.
He and the male author are commiserating at a strip club this very moment.
An actress whose holiday home was destroyed in a hurricane auditions to play the role of a war correspondent in a film based on a true story.
She reads a heart-wrenching scene in which her love interest is killed in a drone strike and the director is brought to tears.
There's an 80-90% chance that John and the male author are talking about her hotness in the strip club.
"With her extensive experience, formidable knowledge and composed temperament, she runs for a powerful government position."
Yet the election is won by a two-bit blowhard salesman who has limited understanding of the world and the impulse control of an untrained teacup Chihuahua.
"He and his male cabinet proceed to destroy everything in their path with a unique combination of racism, arrogance, and stupidity."
What Works: Gender Equality by Design.
"Work With Me: How Gender Intelligence Can Help You Succeed at Work and in Life, by Barbara Annis and John Gray."
"My children, like many of their generation, would vehemently reject any accusation of sexism, but the fact that even among their age group so many assume the surgeon is male shows how persistent unconscious gender bias is."
"It is also one of many readable examples with which Iris Bohnet, professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, peppers What Works: Gender Equality by Design."
She kicks off with the example of orchestras.
"Making musicians audition behind a screen, a measure first introduced by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the 1970s, resulted in a big increase in the number of women players taken on."
"Other examples from the US, India, China, the UK and elsewhere paint a picture of a world still in the grip of gender stereotypes, where women trade being seen as likeable for being regarded as competent."
"Women who ask for better pay, says Bohnet, violate gender norms in most societies, a finding that Jennifer Lawrence, the Academy Award-winning actress, would back up."
"When a journalist revealed last year how much less she was paid than her male co-stars, Lawrence wrote: I would be lying if I didn't say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight."
"Until I saw the payroll on the internet and realised every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being ""difficult"" or ""spoiled'""."
"I have just taken a test that Bohnet uses in the book, Harvard's implicit association test, which, much to my disgust, says I associate men with careers and women with families."
"In recent years, Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In and Anne-Marie Slaughter's Unfinished Business have both focused on why women are still less successful in the workplace than men and propose solutions to match their interpretations."
"For Sandberg, the key to ""having it all"" is for women, with the support of men, to take responsibility for aspiring to the top jobs."
Slaughter by contrast argues that the status quo makes it impossible to combine work and motherhood satisfactorily and that it is the world of work that needs to change.
Both Lean In and Unfinished Business moved the debate on from consciousness-raising about gender inequality at work to potential solutions.
"Yet for some, the ""corporate feminism"" of writers such as Sandberg misses the point."
"Foster argues that only by removing the structural obstacles to gender equality will we change behaviour in the long run, and she provides many examples of what she means."
"The increasing prevalence of zero-hour contracts in the UK, the cutting of child benefit if you have more than two children (unless you have twins or are raped), the scaling back of domestic violence services” all are backward steps for women's empowerment."
There are good arguments to be made that addressing the lack of women at the top of organisations Sandberg's focus ignores the needs of women at the bottom.
"This is a shame, since there is a strong counterargument to be made against corporate feminism."
"If we are to opt for a more gradualist approach to tackling gender bias, then perhaps the place to start is better communication."
"Why, ask Gray and Annis, has the proportion of female chief executives in the US just 3 per cent in 1996 barely budged?"
"Their answer is that men and women's brains are wired differently and that they communicate, and thus work, in extremely different ways."
"Instead, companies must become more gender intelligent, a goal achieved through educating men to understand the unique value that women bring to the table and educating women as to the reasons why men think and behave as they do."
"Differences in the ways men and women communicate lead to misunderstandings and setbacks in the office, there are few examples of how such problems have been overcome."
"In What Works, Bohnet's approach to the question of how we should tackle gender bias begins with a recognition of just how hard this is."
"She quotes experiments suggesting that the more biased you are, the more difficult it is to change your views, even if you are provided with information to help you to do so."
"The answer, she suggests, is not to be found in diversity training programmes or other similarly well-intentioned initiatives."
"Bohnet is also scathing about self-evaluation and argues that, since women tend to be more self-critical than men, it can lead to lower performance ratings and thus worsen the gender pay gap."
"Instead, she advocates changing environments rather than mindsets."
Bohnet is particularly convincing on the power of data in identifying and addressing gender inequalities.
More generous maternity and paternity leave policies appear to have eliminated it.
"As academic dean of the Kennedy School from 2011 to 2014, she has also put some of her theories into practice."
"Practical suggestions from her own experience are summarised at the end of each chapter, covering recruitment, pay negotiations, performance evaluation, teamwork and schooling."
"Some of the most useful are around interviews and evaluations, where our unconscious biases can be given their freest rein."
She also gives pointers to software programmes available to make the task easier.
"The test for a book like this is not whether it is persuasive or useful for a reader such as me, already sensitised to and eager to take action on gender bias in the workplace."
"The findings, which are part of a broader study of judicial behavior, revealed that the judges were just as likely as laypeople to discriminate - in ways that harmed both men and women - in decisions involving child custody or workplace discrimination cases related to family caregiving duties."
"For this analysis, the only thing that varied in each case was the race and gender of those involved in the disputes."
"""We're giving them identical case facts and we're only changing a couple of variables that should be legally irrelevant - race and gender,"" Miller said."
"After the judges made their rulings, they filled out surveys that tested their gender and racial attitudes."
"""The gender ideologies test measured how much the judges consciously support traditional gender roles, where women are more or less confined to domestic caregiving roles and men are confined to more public, career-based roles,"" Miller said."
Judges in the shared-custody case were more likely than laypeople to give a mother more time with a child than a father.
"The judges gave mothers, on average, about half a day more time with their children than they gave fathers."
"The judges' tendency to discriminate in this manner coincided with their traditional gender ideologies: The more they supported traditional gender roles for men and women, the more parenting time they gave to the mother in the case."
"""In the shared-custody case, the judges were influenced more by gender than the lay sample,"" Miller said."
"In a workplace discrimination case involving family caregiving, the gender of the plaintiff also affected judges more than laypeople."
"""Overall, the judges and the laypeople both saw the woman's case as having more merit than the man's,"" Miller said."
"""But the more the judges supported traditional gender roles, the more likely they were to rule against a woman plaintiff on the merits."
"In other words, decisions in the woman's discrimination case were influenced by the judges' personal ideologies about the proper roles for men and women""."
Miller said she wasn't surprised that judges can be influenced by the gender of plaintiffs.
But she was surprised that judges' expertise in family law did not reduce their tendency to be influenced by their personal ideas about gender.
Miller is sharing her findings with the judges in the study and working with them to find ways to reduce the role of their personal biases in their courtroom decision-making.
Why Do Fathers Give Up Custody Instead of Fight For Custody?
I hear a lot about how the courts are biased in favor of mothers when it comes to deciding child custody.
"After doing a bit of research on the subject I've come to the conclusion, based on child custody statistics, that the courts are not the reason mothers gain custody in the majority of divorces."
"Since two-income households are now the norm, not the exception, the above information indicates that not only are mothers working they are also doing twice as much child care as fathers."
It only makes sense that mothers who have a closer bond due to the time spent caring for a child be the one more likely to obtain custody during a divorce.
"But, with changing attitudes toward child custody fathers are still likely to gain at least 50/50 custody if they are willing to fight for it."
"Divorced or Unwed Fathers: More startling are the stats on absent fathers, or the amount of time fathers spend with children once the divorce is final."
"According to the Pew Research study, when fathers and children live separately 22% of fathers see their children more than once a week."
"Twenty-nine percent of fathers see their children, 1-4 times a month."
"The most disturbing though, 27% of fathers have no contact with their children."
When you take into consideration that mothers spend more time taking care of children before divorce and only 22% of fathers take advantage of spending what I would consider quality and quantitative time with their children after the divorce the fact that more mothers obtain custody seems reasonable.
"What doesn't seem reasonable is the noise that the Men's Rights movement makes about gender bias in Family Court, not based on the statistics."
"Seriously, if father's are interested in equal parenting time after divorce, why are the majority of them spending no time at all with their children?"
"In 51% of the cases, both parents agreed that mom be the custodial parent."
"In cases where both parents decided, without involvement from a mediator or the court 83% of the time the mother ended up with custody because the father chose to give her custody."
Fathers are less involved in their children's care during the marriage.
Fathers are less involved in their children's lives after divorce.
Mothers gain custody because the vast majority of fathers choose to give the mother custody.
There is no Family Court bias in favor of mothers for the majority of fathers who divorce.
The argument that Men's Rights activists make doesn't hold water.
Why do you suppose fathers are so quick to give most of the custody to mothers?
"Fathers view themselves as breadwinners, the ones who provide for the family."
"Mothers are viewed as caretakers, the ones who take care of the children."
Maybe those views carry over into divorce situations and play a role into the reason more men don't seek more custody and time with their children.
"Also, divorce attorneys are old school and most will tell a father that gaining more custody rights will be an uphill battle."
"With self-imposed societal views, lazy divorce attorneys and men's rights groups pushing the notion of gender bias, it is no wonder fewer men give up before even trying."
"If you are a father reading this, I urge you to find an attorney willing to go to bat for you and your relationship with your children."
"It may cost you more but, being able to parent equally with your ex is worth the investment."
The tally of complaints filed by women in U.S. technical roles at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016 was part of an unsealing of documents filed by plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit against the company.
"Female Microsoft employees in U.S. technical roles filed 118 complaints of gender discrimination with the company between 2010 and 2016, according to court documents."
"Adding in complaints of sexual harassment, retaliation and pregnancy discrimination, women at the Redmond-based technology giant formally raised issues about their treatment to human resources a total of 238 times, according to the court documents."
The scope of women's complaints against the company was made public Monday as part of an unsealing of documents in the lawsuit.
"Three women, current and former Microsoft employees, are suing the company, alleging systemic gender discrimination against women in engineering jobs that led to lower pay and a stunted pace of promotions."
The disparity between the number of complaints filed and how many Microsoft found to be policy violations illustrates a key divide in the way many female employees view the company's culture and the inclusive setting that Microsoft says it is striving to create.
"Microsoft's case is one of many piling up against giant companies in the technology industry, which has come under fire in recent years for its dearth of female and minority employees and for a workplace culture that some say is hostile toward those groups."
"The plaintiffs' suit seeks class-action status, a designation that could add more than 8,600 women to the case."
"They say women in the class lost out on up to $238 million in pay and 500 promotions because of widespread discrimination, largely within the company's performance-review process that determines pay and promotions for employees."
The plaintiffs argue that men in similar roles with similar job performance were promoted faster and given more raises than their female colleagues.
Microsoft has said a class action isn't warranted because there is no common cause for the employees' complaints and plaintiffs have not identified systemic gender discrimination.
The company has denied that systemic gender bias is taking place through its employee-review process.
"The crux of the lawsuit alleges systemic gender discrimination, but it also addresses sexual harassment in some situations."
"Women in technical roles reported 108 incidents of alleged sexual harassment and assault to the company between 2010 and 2016, court documents say, separate from the 118 gender discrimination complaints."
Three women alleged they were sexually assaulted or raped by male colleagues during that time.
The one gender discrimination case was filed in 2016.
"Newly unredacted sections of the plaintiffs' court filings, which were first reported by Reuters on Tuesday, also show the frustration of some women, citing emails they wrote over the years to managers and executives."
"Microsoft's workforce is largely white and male, mirroring the tech industry."
9 percent was female.
Its technical employees were 19 percent female.
"Lawyers for Microsoft and the plaintiffs have been throwing legal barbs at each other in the case for more than two years, in the form of studies into the company's review and investigative practices and in testimony from experts in the fields of human resources, gender studies and workplaces."
"Korean television entertainment shows are still replete with gender stereotypes and even comical portrayals of sexual violence, according to a recent study."
The Korean Institute for Gender Equality Promotion and Education said on Thursday that monitoring of the 33 most watched TV entertainment shows aired in the first seven days of March found 56 cases of gender bias.
"This was eight times the number of cases in which content promoted gender equality over the same period, and nearly triple the 19 cases of gender bias found in July last year."
"Much of the gender discriminatory contents reinforced gender stereotypes or lookism, and some even justified sexual harassment or sexual violence."
Male cast members hugged her and shook her body one after another.
"In another segment of the same show, a female cast member drew laughter by continuing to make sexual advances toward a man despite his refusals."
"On a cable TV show, a male cast member revealed gender bias by saying, ""The government must crack down on brunch meetings of three or more women because no real estate or education policy can succeed as long as they have brunch meetings."""
"A day after a new policy is announced, women meet up for brunch, build strategies and take group actions."
Another cable TV show had a male cast member asking the audience to rearrange their seating by their physical attractiveness.
"Despite growing efforts to eradicate gender discrimination and sexual violence, television entertainment programs have a long way to go in terms of gender equality."
A higher level of gender sensitivity is required for broadcasters and production staff in order to stop rationalizing or justifying gender discrimination or sexual violence.
The KIGEPE plans to request the Korea Communications Standards Commission for censorship of some of the cases of gender bias found in its monitoring of the shows in March.
"But one of the most fascinating aspects that truly makes the game stand out among the sea of other open-world blockbuster role-playing games is how character customization, appearance, and gender actually have direct impacts on the story."
"While the option to play as one of two genders is always appreciated, countless other games like Fallout 4 treat it like a purely aesthetic change."
"But as we know, gender is far more than an exterior appearance in the real world."
"Gender is not only a defining characteristic of self-identification, but also a huge factor in how the world perceives and treats you."
"Now, we're not yet sure how much of an impact choosing whether protagonist V presents as a man or woman will actually have."
"Pears said that all these customizations, whether it be through fashion or gender or tech, go back to character expression, even for NPCs."
CD Projekt Red isn't ready to reveal too much more about the extent of its exploration of gender identity as a core world-building element.
"Can you change genders during the game, since you can change so much else through RipperDocs?"
How exactly does being a woman or man change the way NPCs treat you?
One potential in the demo stood out as a possibility: The RipperDoc you visit has a crush on V; but we only got to see V played as a woman.
What's the ethnic and gender makeup of Vida's writers room?
"This room is all Latinx, and we use the term Latinx, not Latino and Latina, we take away gender by putting an X."
"There's one male, a straight cis male and the rest are female-identified, and half of us are queer."
"But sometimes when you're the token, you become the cultural ambassador, especially if you're the only person of color in the room and the only woman, which I was for a few months."
She was an activist from Boyle Heights.
And I love that we use it because it is about sisters.
"But a new study suggests that, no matter where children live, real talk about relationships, identity and sexuality should start even earlier to minimize the negative impacts of gender roles."
"You've probably heard it before : More than biology, family, friends and society influence impressions of what it means to be a boy or a girl, placing rigid gender expectations on children from a young age."
"In recent years, a growing body of research has focused on health inequities that result from enforced gender norms in children."
"The key finding: Whether a child is in Baltimore, Beijing or New Delhi, the onset of adolescence triggers a common set of rigidly enforced gender expectations associated with increased lifelong risks of mental and physical health problems."
Researchers with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the World Health Organization collaborated on the Global Early Adolescent Study to identify universal themes in gender identity development across countries and income levels.
"""Adolescent health risks are shaped by behaviors rooted in gender roles that can be well-established in kids by the time they are 10 or 11 years old,"" said Kristin Mmari, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and lead researcher for qualitative research on the Global Early Adolescent Study."
"For girls, those risks can include child marriage, pregnancy, leaving school early, sexually transmitted infections and exposure to violence."
"Boys suffer, too, from increased risk of substance abuse, suicide and shorter life expectancy than women -- especially if they try to challenge masculine norms."
"The study calls it the hegemonic myth: the perception that men are the dominant sex, strong and independent, while women need to be protected."
"Girls are vulnerable, and boys are strong ."
Interviews with children and their guardians revealed that the onset of puberty triggers increased reinforcement of pressure to conform to hegemonic sex-typed identities and roles.
"While boys, men described having the freedom to come and go as they pleased to pursue education and other opportunities, girls found their mobility and access to education restricted, the study notes."
"As they enter adolescence, silence and modesty are instilled as desirable values, as girls are pressed to behave in a ""modest fashion""."
This phenomenon leads to numerous cascading cultural perceptions.
"Puberty deepens the divide, especially when it comes to sexuality, turning boys into predators and girls into potential targets, the study found."
"Messages such as ""don't sit like that,"" ""don't wear that"" and ""boys will ruin your future"" reinforce the gender division of power and promote sex segregation with the aim of preserving a girl's sexuality, the study says."
"""In some places, girls come to internalize these norms to even a greater extent than boys""."
"In Delhi, once a girl reaches puberty, ""her family is concerned with protecting her chastity, preventing elopement and fears stigma from losing family honor,"" the researchers said."
"Girls there are not supposed to look at or talk to boys, ""as this might raise suspicion that they were initiating romantic relationships""."
"The researchers also found that, despite efforts to normalize menstruation and breast development, negative societal attitudes further contribute to girls' sense of self-objectification, body shame and lack of agency in sexual decision-making."
"""The onset of menstruation appeared to constitute a major concern for parents as they linked puberty with the potential for early romantic and sexual engagements and subsequent risk of adolescent pregnancy,"" the study said."
"Cover up, and don't go out' As a consequence of adult perceptions of girls' sexual vulnerability, respondents in nearly every location reported that girls' mobility is far more restricted than it is for boys."
"In Ghent, Belgium, respondents spoke of how girls had to take care in selecting their clothing or risk being seen as ""too easy"" or ""prostitutes,"" making them potential victims of violence."
"An 11-year-old in Delhi expressed a similar sentiment: ""Parents also tell (girls) not to go out alone."
She will not be allowed to do a job.
I really don't understand why girls are not allowed to go out of the house.
"A young girl in Nairobi, Kenya, described not being able to go out at night because she had grown breasts."
"Parental fear for girls' safety and family status is a common rationale for restricting girls' movements, especially in the Middle East and among some immigrant groups in Western Europe."
"""This constricted spatial mobility of girls is linked to restricted knowledge and power and can have profound health implications for girls in the form of more susceptibility to sexual violence and poor access to reproductive health services, in addition to loss of prestige especially among poor families,"" the study said."
"Despite the freedom and benefits conferred upon them, boys are still perceived as a danger to girls because of their vulnerability -- a bias with negative impacts for both genders, researchers said."
"In Delhi and Shanghai, girls said they were discouraged from interacting with boys, becoming friends them or forming romantic relationships."
"""I don't make friends with boys, as my parents asked me not to,"" a 12-year-old in Delhi said."
Boys are trouble
Gender-nonconforming has consequences
"""Maybe I befriend a girl and someone would see me and would go tell her dad, and problems happen,"" a boy in Assiut, Egypt, said."
"A recurring theme in conversations with adolescents and adults was those who defied gender expectations, resulting in ""significant sanctions and pressures to conform,"" the study said."
"The study focuses on three common manifestations of defiance: boys wearing nail polish, girls playing football or soccer, and gender-""inappropriate"" clothing."
"For young children, it may start as acceptable to cross gender boundaries."
"But once it becomes clear that a behavior is socially defined as typical for the other sex, ""it is shunned out of fear of being ostracized,"" the study said."
"Moreover, ""tomboy"" behavior in girls enjoyed more peer and parental acceptance than their male ""sissy"" counterparts, who faced significantly more stigma and rejection, the study said."
"Though boys too resist typical masculine norms, researchers discovered a greater willingness among girls to challenge gender stereotypes."
"""A potential explanation for this may be that girls who 'act like boys' display masculine characteristics associated with power and dominance,"" researchers surmised."
"Conversely, ""boys who 'act like girls' are generally not granted the same social acceptance because of the lower power or prestige associated with femininity traits and behaviors""."
"The actor, who played Prince Philip on the first two seasons of the Netflix series, was paid more than Claire Foy , who starred as Queen Elizabeth II."
"Left Bank Productions said it supports ""the conversation which is rightly being played out across society and we are absolutely united with the fight for fair pay, free of gender bias, and for a re-balancing of the industry's treatment of women, both those in front of the camera and for those behind the scenes""."
"At the time, the company said it planned to enter into ""talks"" with the U.K. arm of Time's Up and ERA 50:50, a British movement of actors and actresses campaigning for gender equality on British television and stage, ""to make our contribution to the debate""."
Former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus decried President Donald Trump's efforts to prevent transgender individuals from serving in the military.
"""This notion that all of this work's been done and these people felt safe as transgender, felt safe coming out, joining the military, and then suddenly the rug gets jerked out from under -- it's not the way to treat patriots, it's not the way to build a great military force either,"" Mabus said on ""The Axe Files,"" a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN."
"Mabus, who served as head of the Navy under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, lamented that the Pentagon ""didn't move fast enough"" in instituting a policy to allow transgender individuals to openly serve in the military."
That policy was still under review in July 2017 when Trump announced in a series of tweets that he would reinstate the ban on transgender troops.
"The investigations center on a handful of the universities' women-only groups, like USC's Women in Science and Engineering group and the Yale Women Innovators, as well as scholarships and fellowships that are open only to women."
"The probes, according to a Wall Street Journal article last week, tap into a concern among a faction of white men nationwide that they are being left behind by affirmative action and other programs aimed at helping minorities and women."
"The Journal also quotes Mark Perry, a faculty member at the University of Michigan-Flint who filed a 2016 civil rights complaint over a women-only study lounge."
"Women are still treated like they're underrepresented, like they're weak and victims and need all this support, Perry told the paper."
"Over the last few weeks, Pekgoz has been interviewed over email (his preferred method) by a number of outlets, where he describes himself as a detached and hyper-logical champion of human rights who just happened to stumble upon these grave instances of anti-male bias."
"In an email to me, he says he filed his complaints so that women, as the majority in colleges, will be able to compete with men, the minority, on equal footing"
"Over the last few years, DOE investigations like this have focused on what is perceived as anti-male bias in sexual harassment and assault cases; Yale has been sued by at least three men since 2011 over Title IX investigations."
"The visibility of such accusations of bias has added fuel to a growing and increasingly mainstream men's rights movement, the central conceit of which is that feminism's victories have overcorrected, making America a dangerous place for the straight, white, and male."
"Pekgoz would seem to be a likely avatar for this movement, given his affiliations with men's rights activists, and what he describes to me as an outpouring of support since he's taken this public stance."
"So would the fact that he was involved in his own bizarre Title IX investigation at USC, which concluded about a year before he started speaking publicly about ending affirmative action for women in schools."
"But wouldn't it seem relevant that a person accusing colleges of bias was entangled in a drawn-out Title IX investigation, and accused a woman in his department of ruining his reputation and career?"
"Advertisement In the complaint Pekgoz sent to the DOE in February, obtained by Campus Reform this month, he writes that Yale violates Title IX by funding discriminatory programs, such as women-only scholarships."
Men are a minority at Yale University (48%) and nationwide enrollment rates for men are even lower.
"Therefore, affirmative action for women in colleges is irrational: Indeed it would only stand to reason to implement affirmative action for male students."
"He was involved in his own bizarre Title IX investigation at USC, which concluded about a year before he started speaking publicly about ending affirmative action for women in schools."
"Since the investigations first appeared in the press and Pekgoz started getting interviewed about his complaints, he has said he only wants to make such opportunities gender-neutral, and that filing these complaints is a political hobby of his."
To Fox he said it was because Yale has a much more toxic environment against men
"He's right, suing businesses for anti-male bias isn't a new practice for men's rights activists."
"Pekgoz told the Daily Beast he is an active member of the men's rights group National Coalition of Men (NCFM), members of whom met with education secretary Betsy DeVos last year."
"In Turkey, he says he worked for a non-profit that aimed to eliminate illiteracy for women."
"A few details about said lawsuit: In the spring of 2015, according to sworn testimony and a Title IX summary filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court, Pekgoz and a woman in his department had a brief sexual relationship, which the woman alleged that she ended."
He allegedly followed the woman to a professor's office when she sought guidance on how to file a complaint.
"A few weeks later, the woman opted to file a formal complaint after Pekgoz created a fake Facebook account to contact her ex-boyfriend, as recounted in court documents."
"When Pekgoz was interviewed about the allegations, he requested that the investigator file a counter-complaint against the woman, alleging his own instance of sexual harassment."
One wouldn't be crazy to wonder if the fact that Pekgoz had previous contact with both schools he filed complaints against was connected to his belief that these schools unfairly protect women and shun men.
It was intended to prove the woman at USC with whom he'd had a relationship had violated the no contact order; administrators were not so convinced.
"Nine days after the investigations were closed, Pekgoz filed a lawsuit alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the woman, claiming that she had falsely accused him of sexual harassment and blackmail, as well as using threats of violence."
She didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.
"As part of the decision, Pekgoz was ordered to pay $50,000 of the woman's legal fees."
"Pekgoz is currently represented by Mark Hathaway, a Los Angeles-area attorney who since 2013 has represented a little under a dozen men alleging the mishandling of Title IX proceedings."
"In the majority of the successful cases Hathaway has litigated, men have been accused of rape and suspended or expelled following a Title IX investigation."
The Department of Education's investigation of anti-male bias at Yale and USC's women's-only programming is ongoing.
A publication by Human Rights Watch claims the Chinese Government is posting Public Service job advertisements that discriminate against women.
"The publication, Only Men Need Apply, says there are growing levels of discrimination in the wording of job advertisements."
"The non-governmental organisation (NGO), which fights against human rights abuses, said that in 2017 some 13 per cent of China's national Public Service job listings had positions specifying men only, men preferred or suitable for men."
"Need to work overtime frequently, high-intensity work, only men need apply."
"China Director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson said Chinese authorities needed to act now to enforce existing laws to end Government and private hiring practices that blatantly discriminated against women."
"She said of the Ministries or local affiliates that posted at least 100 job advertisements, the top violator of gender non-discrimination laws was the Railway Public Security Bureau, for which all postings contained the requirement male preference or male only."
Human Rights Watch noted that it had also found one advertisement that stated women were preferred.
A spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Government would investigate and prosecute organisations that published gender discriminatory job advertisements.
More and more employers are exploring unconscious bias and what they can do to manage the damage caused by biases people may not even realize they harbor.
Most of the attention has focused on unconscious bias's effect on hiring and how it causes uncomfortable interactions between coworkers and the public.
Recent research delving into the words used in performance evaluations shows how both positive and negative characteristics documented in performance reviews can differ between men and women.
A May 25 Harvard Business Review article explains research that analyzed a large set of military evaluations and how the language used in the subjective portion of performance evaluations differed between men and women.
"Because of the military's emphasis on equal opportunity and its focus on merit, it presents a setting where we might expect less gender bias in performance evaluations"
The most commonly used negative term for men was arrogant while the most common negative term for women was inept
"The legal risks posed by gender bias may not be as important as the damage it can do to an organization's culture, she says, but bias does present a risk of discrimination claims, including disparate impact claims."
Meller explains that disparate impact stems from an employer's seemingly neutral practice that results in a statistically significant adverse impact on women or some other group.
"Good employers strive to attract and retain talent, and good people don't want to work in an environment where such gender biases exist."
"What to Do To prevent unconscious bias from damaging a performance review system, Meller has some suggestions: Training reviewers to be aware of the danger of implicit bias can help."
"Reviewers can still diverge and let the conversation flow naturally, she says, but the structure can prevent people from evaluating based on gender, race, or other characteristics."
"Employers that don't have a system in place such as a handbook to make sure policies are standardized and applied evenly are at greatest risk of legal trouble stemming from implicit gender bias, she says."
"But a lack of focus around culture and gender inclusiveness are stunting its true promise, according to a new report out of Drexel University."
"Instructors consistently refer to their male students using maker terminology geek,builders,and then overwhelmingly referred to their female students as girls."
Among their findings: a troubling lack of women in makerspace leadership and a pronounced tendency to see boys as more tech-proficient.
"As a whole, STEM fields experience significant gender imbalances and makerspaces are no exception despite being a relatively recent adoption for many schools."
"Among the programs examined, men occupied 76 percent of the leadership roles, while women held just 24 percent."
"While gender parity among students was observed in early grades, participation by girls dropped 25 percent between 8th grade and high school."
"And it didn't stop there gender bias was even more pronounced, which the report called deeply unsettling"
"By contrast, adults never referred to groups of male students as boys"
"In addition, boys were twice as likely to hold leadership positions within makerspaces and to steer major project topics."
"Gender bias has been around for generations and making is hardly immune in that respect, notes Sue Cusack, an assistant professor of education technology at Lesley University and co-director of the Lesley STEAM Learning Lab, which has helped Boston Public Schools design makerspaces and train educators."
"Fifty years on from the historic strike in Dagenham, Ford shares how it's since led the way in championing gender balance in the workplace"
"This month marks the 50th anniversary since 187 female sewing-machinists walked out from Ford's east London factory, triggering the 1970 Equal Pay Act."
Gender equality at Ford: 50 years since the Dagenham strikes.
"Ford's diversity and inclusion manager Lara Nicoll, told HR magazine it's important that the company never loses sight of this historic event, and has used it to motivate ongoing gender equality improvements at Ford."
A lot of the discrimination stemmed from the socioeconomic structure at the time that people used to justify paying women less.
"Women very rarely went on strike, so it was quite shocking, Nicoll said."
"We really appreciate the contribution those women have made to improving women's rights, so for us it's about showing how much we value the women in our organisation and making sure we've got the policies in place that prove that."
"Unequal gender pay continues to be an issue within all industries in the UK, with April's gender pay gap reporting figures showing an average gap of 17% in favour of men."
"Part of the secret behind Ford's success is down to forging connections with schools and educators to build a strong pipeline of female talent, Nicoll said."
"Motoring is still a male-dominated industry, with women accounting for less than 12% of people in engineering."
"We have to get more women in to the sector, but you can't wait until university to do that you need to start developing that talent at a much earlier age."
Ford has been working with the government to boost the number of women and girls studying STEM subjects.
"It has supported initiatives such The Greenpower Trust, which works to promote sustainable engineering among young people, and the First Lego League events."
The company has worked on tackling unconscious bias through setting up events that it encourages both men and women to attend.
"We realise that women can be less confident in the workplace, and have set up a range of developing and networking opportunities to support women,"" said Nicoll."
"""We encourage men to attend them too though, to really understand some of the obstacles women experience"
"Nicoll added that creating opportunities for women, particularly through engaging girls at an early stage, was the most important factor in improving gender equality."
For us the key to driving gender balance is about increasing opportunities for women.
"If we can do that we won't just improve our industry, we'll reduce the gender pay gap across the UK"
As the 90s dawned things were looking up for women.
"Daughters of second-wave feminism came of age and chose new paths unavailable to their mothers: delaying marriage and children, pursuing higher education, joining the workforce, and assuming independence and identities outside of the home."
"For more than a century, the median marriage age for women swung between 20 and 22, but in 1990, it nearly jumped to 24."
Postponing marriage and kids liberated women sexually; it also gave them increased economic power and paved their entry into male-dominated careers.
"Almost half of married women surveyed in 1995 reported earning half or more of their total family income, leading the study's sponsor to declare, ""Women are the new providers""."
"90s Bitch: Media, Culture, and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality (Harper Perennial, 2018)."
"The forward motion of the 90s seemed to build on the 80s, a decade of hallowed female pioneers in diverse fields."
Sally Ride traveled to space.
Geraldine Ferraro secured the vice presidential nomination of a major political party.
"Alice Walker and Toni Morrison won Pulitzer Prizes for their epic, women-centered fiction."
"Madonna smashed barriers in music, entertainment and popular culture."
"Because these firsts and many others were so widely celebrated, society assumed these trailblazing women would also cut a path for all women to advance in work, entertainment, politics and culture in the years to come."
"At last, the dream of gender equality would be realized."
But a quick glance back at the 90s would suggest that American women indeed made significant progress during the decade.
"In Janet Reno, Madeleine Albright, Judith Rodin and Carly Fiorina, the 90s saw the first woman attorney general, secretary of state, president of an Ivy League institution (University of Pennsylvania), and CEO of a Fortune 100 company (Hewlett-Packard)."
"More women won political office than ever before in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman, when their numbers in the Senate tripled (from a measly two to a small but more respectable six)."
"Cultural feminism in the 90s made strides, as well."
"Indie subcultures defined by girl-made zines, music, art and websites flourished, providing young women new platforms for self-expression."
"Girl culture was reclaimed and celebrated by the Riot Grrrl movement, Sassy magazine, websites like gURL.com, government initiatives, subversive feminist musicians and independent films."
"By the end of the decade, however, the promise of equality for women was revealed to be something between a false hope and a cruel hoax."
"Parity, it turned out, was paradox: The more women assumed power, the more power was taken from them through a noxious popular culture that celebrated outright hostility toward women and commercialized their sexuality and insecurity."
Feminist movements were co-opted.
"Soon, women would author their own sexual objectification."
"I call what was done to women in the 90s bitchification, and it coincided with a radical new media landscape."
"This continuous, addictive format produced an unrelenting fixation on public figures and news makers, but none so much as the women gaining power and prominence in the 90s."
"When any woman made the news, she often stayed there for days, weeks, months, and, in some cases, years."
"Meanwhile, news consumers blamed women for their own unceasing visibility, as if they had narcissistically engineered unflattering coverage of themselves for personal gain."
"In the end, the 1990s didn't advance women and girls; rather, the decade was marked by a shocking, accelerating effort to subordinate them."
"As women gained power, or simply showed up in public, society pushed back by reducing them to gruesome sexual fantasies and misogynistic stereotypes."
"Women's careers, clothes, bodies, and families were skewered."
The trailblazing women of the 90s were excoriated by a deeply sexist society.
"Stories of notable women in the 90s almost invariably suggest they were sluts, whores, trash, prudes, idiots, frauds, emasculators, nutcrackers and succubi."
These disparagements were so embedded in the cultural dialogue about women that many of us have never stopped to question them.
"I spoke with more than a hundred women about their remembrances of the 90s, and the majority of them internalized 90s bitchification, too."
"The stories of 90s women have become sexist mythology, an erroneous history that saps women of their power, just as it was intended to do."
"Discrediting women based solely on their gender, sexually harassing them and reducing them to their sexuality endures today from the school yard to the boardroom in part because this was, writ large, ubiquitous and accepted behavior in the 90s."
But it wasn't until returning to this decade as an adult that I came to see how mainstream 90s narratives in media and society promoted sexism and exploited girlhood.
I was utterly shocked by what I found while investigating 90s narratives about women.
"It was supposed to be the modern era, with doors flung open to unprecedented advancement for women and gender equality."
"Taken together, these stories explain the status of women in American society today."
"Excerpted from 90s Bitch: Media, Culture, and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality (Harper Perennial, 2018)."
"The US Supreme Court has questioned the legality of the bid by a small group of women to represent more than a million others in suing Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, for alleged gender bias."
The court on Tuesday was hearing whether the largest sex discrimination lawsuit in US history should go ahead.
"The women, who are suing Walmart for being discriminated against in pay and promotions, want to bring a class action suit on behalf of other female employees."
"If the court rejects the class-action status, the individual women still can sue, both sides in the case say."
"""Due process"" During the session, some justices strongly questioned the women's arguments."
"Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt ""whipsawed"" by the plaintiffs' argument and said they had not made clear whether it was Walmart's corporate culture or local store managers who were allegedly at fault for lower pay and fewer promotions to women."
"Walmart's attorney, Theodore Boutrous, said female employees in different jobs and in different stores do not have enough in common to be in a single class-action lawsuit."
"Joseph Sellers, an attorney for the women, argued the class-action lawsuit should be allowed to go to trial for a decision on the merits of the claims."
"She recalled being told by a manager to ""brush the cobwebs off"" and ""doll up"" if she wanted advancement."

"Here's a look at how the day is being marked around the world: 'A Day Without Women' Women's day strikes, or what is being called A Day Without Women, and other actions have been planned in more than 40 countries on Wednesday."
Organisers have urged women to take a day off work or school to call attention to the economic bias faced by women.
"""Many women in our most vulnerable communities will not have the ability to join the strike, due to economic insecurity."

Is woman to nurse as man is to doctor?
"Indeed, the question itself may seem silly considering the historic advancements of women over the past century."
"And while the ACA is a critical step in improving Americans' health, it does not improve the gender gap within medicine itself."
Many healthcare providers can attest to the subtle - and sometimes blatant - gender biases that remain pervasive in medicine.
"Despite tremendous achievements over the last several decades, women physicians still face barriers to professional advancement."
"In the last several decades, medicine has been increasingly accessible to women, who now comprise nearly half of all medical students in the US."
"Women have also made significant headway in traditionally male-dominated specialties, such as general surgery, and are particularly prominent in specialties such as obstetrics/gynecology and pediatrics."
Women make up only a third of physicians today.
"They remain underrepresented in a number of subspecialties, earn 37 percent less than their male colleagues, and get promoted lessoften in academic medicine than their male counterparts."
"As in other fields, many people have weighed in to explain this discrepancy, suggesting that women do not value monetary compensation and therefore gravitate towards lower paying specialties than men."
"They have also suggested that women under-perform in medicine because they are not professionally driven, choosing to prioritise personal responsibilities at the expense of career advancement and economic gain."
"And even if we take these allegations seriously, the gender disparity persists when these factors are controlled for in studies."
Women are simply not rewarded or recognised for similar work performed by men.
"The problem, then, is not that women choose the ""wrong"" specialty or do not care enough about their careers."
It is that gender bias and discrimination are pervasive in medicine.
"Despite laws forbidding such practices, women are often questioned in job interviews about their intentions to start families or become pregnant."
"They are viewed with suspicion when they interview for jobs, their colleagues often wondering silently - or even out loud - if their right to maternity leave will shift the burden of work to other physicians who have to cover the workload."
"I have heard this from many female physicians over the years, and I doubt that male physicians are similarly questioned about their intentions to have families and what this will mean for the work environment."
Studies have also shown that women do not enjoy the same level of professional status as male physicians.
Women are often targets of gender stereotyping and discrimination.
"As a female physician, I, like so many others, have experienced this personally."
"As one of my female colleagues very matter-of-factly asked me, ""How many times have you been mistaken for a nurse""?"
Gender bias and work environment
And while the assumption is neither meant nor construed as an insult - I am proud to work alongside some of the best and hardest working male and female nurses - it is indicative of an inherent gender bias.
"Most patients are embarrassed by their presumptions when they are pointed out, but I wonder if they are aware of it the next time they are taken care of by a female physician."
Other manifestations of sexism are more subtle.
I have walked into rooms and noticed that male doctors garner more attention than I do from patients.
"Is that because they are male, taller, or because they are viewed with curiosity?"
"The implication is clear: Women have to ""dress the part"" in order to prove themselves."
"It is important to realise that these inequities in medicine belong to everyone - male and female, physician and patient."
Sexism in medicine is not isolated - just ask female investment bankers or athletes - but it is of consequence.
"She prepares breakfast for her family and gets her two children, 9-year-old Fathimah and 5-year-old Ahmed, ready for school, which starts at 7:30am."
"Once she returns home, she tidies her house and takes care of the laundry, before she heads out to her parents' farm, located 1."
"Approximately two hours later, Leena returns home to prepare lunch for her children."
"Throughout the day, she juggles other household duties, including tending to her 4-month-old baby, Moan, while her husband, a fisherman, is out at sea."
"At night, after she tucks her children in, Leena spends three hours making mats out of reeds that grow in nearby marshlands and wetlands."
"Along with 30 other women in her village, 30-year-old Leena sells these multi-coloured woven mats to a cooperative in the capital, Male."
"If the women weave on a regular basis, they can earn up to $65 a month from the activity - which amounts to approximately 30 percent additional income to the average household income in Fiyoaree."
"Like many other women in her village, and many parts of the world, Leena is the primary caregiver for the family, while her husband goes out to work."
"Most of the time, these women also take on the responsibility of collecting water and firewood, as well as growing and harvesting crops."
"Even though the past decades have seen huge changes in many communities for women, in terms of employment, there are still many women who simply cannot have a job away from their villages because of their duties at home."
"This is why home or village-based income-generating opportunities, such as Leena's weaving, are so important."
Leena is a beneficiary of a regional coastal conservation initiative that aims to empower women economically by training them in the traditional Maldivian art of Thun'du Kunaa weaving.
"This income-generating activity also helps women better understand the value of wetlands - and the fundamentally important services they provide, such as the supply of reed for their weaving."
"With their traditional knowledge of sustainability at the household and community level, women can play a critical role in the conservation of natural resources."
"This is the 21st century, and the vital role of gender equality, equity and inclusion in conservation and environmental protection has been receiving increasing attention from both the scientific and political community."
"Empowered with more knowledge on the sustainable use of natural resources, these women can become strong advocates for nature-based approaches to sustainable development."
"Numerous studies have indicated that women also play a crucial part in building resilience: from ensuring that fragile ecosystems are protected, to helping their families become more resilient in the face of natural disasters."
"Additionally, the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has made it crystal clear that a commitment to gender equality is necessary to secure a better future for all."
"""Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls""."
"Be bold for change' Unfortunately, in many nations, gender-based discrimination and inequality are still deeply woven into the social fabric."
"And despite the fact that women play such a critical role in the conservation of ecosystems, their contributions are often overlooked, undervalued, and sadly, undermined."
The recent World Economic Forum predicts that the gender gap won't close entirely until 2186.
"Thankfully, this is the 21st century, and the vital role of gender equality, equity and inclusion in conservation and environmental protection has been receiving increasing attention from both the scientific and political community."
"A large number of international organisations have been relentlessly advocating for the empowerment of women, and for them to take real ownership of the ecosystems upon which they rely."
"This year's theme for International Women's Day is ""Be bold for change""."
"In the Maldives, women like Leena are leading the way."
"By fruitfully engaging in a sustainable income generating activity, Leena encourages other women to take the leap and do the same."
"As increasing numbers of women are empowered through conservation projects that systemically mainstream gender equality into programmatic outcomes, collective efforts in sustainable development become more impactful, and can indeed secure a better future for all."
"Europe's largest bank, has reported the largest difference in male and female staff salaries among large organisations in the UK, as the government looks to pressure big companies to reduce gender pay disparities."
"HSBC on average paid men 59 percent more than women, the biggest difference among companies with more than 5,000 employees in Britain, according to a Reuters analysis of the published data using the mean as the measure."
"The next largest gender pay gaps were at Virgin Atlantic, where men received 58 percent more on average more than women, followed by a unit of Barclays, where female staff earned 48 percent less than male colleagues."
HSBC said it was confident in its approach to pay and made appropriate adjustments if it identified differences between men and women in similar roles which could not be explained by performance or experience.
"Virgin Atlantic said the gap reflected the relatively low number of female pilots in the aviation industry, while Barclays said it had more work to do so women could progress in their careers at the company."
"Politicians can't just keep beating up business while leaving structural inequality untouched,"" tweeted Sophie Walker, leader of the Women's Equality Party."
"Other countries to introduce mandatory gender pay gap reporting include Australia, which passed similar legislation in 2012, and Germany."
"Of those organisations that had published data by 3pm (14:00 GMT) on Wednesday, 97 percent pay men more than women and just three percent pay women the most."
The average gender pay gap among these largest companies is 15.
"It is, of course, unacceptable for any woman to receive less than a man for the same job, in any walk of life or career path."
"But where equal pay and rights would make the greatest material difference - to education, to health and to economic progress - is at the sharp end of inequality: not in Hollywood, but with rural women in developing countries."
"These are the women who make up more than 40 percent of the agricultural workforce, performing labour-intensive tasks like raising livestock and hand-weeding, working much longer hours than men when domestic duties are taken into account."
"Yet these are also the same women often blocked from land ownership, who get just five percent of agricultural support services, 10 percent of agricultural aid, and can access a fraction of the credit available to invest in their farms and families."
Increasing a woman's income by just $10 has the same positive effect on her children's nutrition and health as increasing a man's income by $110.
"Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet."
But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields.
"And with equal access to the same resources as men, the benefits stretch even further to transforming millions of lives and prospects."
"Women farmers typically produce 20-30 percent less than men per hectare, not because they are less efficient but because they have less access to training, credit and inputs like improved seeds and fertilizer."
"By giving women the same opportunities as men, total agricultural output could be boosted by an additional four percent."
"The value of closing the gender gap in agriculture has been demonstrated in places like Bangladesh, where a Dutch-funded project helps train female farmers to become local leaders, or Farm Business Advisors (FBA)."
"It has helped women like Jahanara Begum, 45, bridge the gender gap not only by developing her own seed-selling business and unlocking new credit lines, but by equipping her to support other farmers across more than 250 producer groups."
"Meanwhile, women account for just a quarter of landowners with official rights in Mozambique."
"But when major agricultural trading company EMCL began to recruit and train young women like Josefina dos Santos Lourenco to manage their input supply shops, they were able to simultaneously expand their businesses and begin to address the agricultural gender gap."
"And in Colombia, where women make up 40 percent of the cocoa growers' association COMCACAOT, USAID's Rural Finance Initiative (RFI) has helped re-balance the gender pay gap by helping individual farmers access loans."
"COMCACAOT was able to vouch for 374 of its members, most of whom were women."
"For female members like Lidia Grueso, who herself had already overcome gender barriers to become a manager of COMCACAOT, such support to access credit allows women to afford critical farm inputs and to pay the staff harvesting the cocoa."
"Meanwhile, to reduce the burden of unpaid domestic work for rural women, policy network FANRPAN is working in Ethiopia and Tanzania to make men aware of the need to participate more in household budgeting and chores."
"Following behaviour change workshops in several villages, men have begun to play a more active role in tending home gardens, collecting water and even attending the village cooking classes."
"By bringing men into this domain, the often overlooked hours that women work at home can be reduced, bridging yet another aspect of the gender gap facing female farmers."
"In 1994, we found what then seemed like an unlikely answer to dealing with changing population dynamics: women."
"The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in1994, made news when a number of women groups were able to successfully convince governments of this proposition and shift the debate from population control to women's empowerment."
They were successful because they argued that an investment in women's health and education would lead to economic development.
"During the past 20 years, fertility rates have generally declined as women's rights and opportunities have improved."
"The just-released ICPD Beyond 2014 Global Report notes that high fertility rates of 4 children or more per woman are now confined to just 45 of the world's poorest nations, down from 81 nations in the period 1990-1995."
Nations that stumble on issues of gender equality are more likely to fall behind their neighbours in global development.
"The ICPD report confirms that in most parts of the world today, sexual and reproductive health services have improved significantly, fewer women are dying while giving birth, and more women have access to education and jobs."
"But if so much progress has been made, why are so many women still struggling to realise their full human potential?"
A key reason is the stubborn persistence of poverty and gender inequality.
There is not a single nation on earth where women enjoy economic and political power equal to men.
"But meaningful progress in many nations has empowered a new generation of women who are exercising greater control over their social, economic and reproductive lives."
"Unfortunately, however, such progress toward gender equality is not universal."
"In the last two decades, religious and political divisions have grown wider, both between and within nations, with the human rights of and autonomy of women and girls a frequent touchstone of ideological differences."
"Sadly, women, and especially adolescent girls, have often paid the biggest price in these culture wars."
"Today, one in three women worldwide reports having experienced physical and/or sexual abuse."
"A recent (2013) UN multi-country study on men and violence in Asia found that nearly half of the 10,000 men interviewed reported using physical and/or sexual violence against a female partner."
And nearly a quarter of the men interviewed admitted raping a woman or girl.
Also contributing to gender inequality is the indefensible tolerance for child marriage in a number of societies and cultures.
"In 41 nations, more than 30 per cent of girls marry before 18, and in most cases, these girls will miss opportunities for education and personal growth that would open doors for them in both society and the workforce."
Nations committed to economic growth must put outdated prejudices and cultural preconceptions about the role of women behind them and embrace gender equality in both law and custom.

The boys' voices were getting louder.
"My mind was elsewhere, fascinated by the only girl on their team, who was doing something remarkable."
"""Our team is going to be the best,"" one boy in my first class immediately announced."
"Our heroes - in both our history and our fiction - are dominantly men (we're not so keen on women) who did whatever crazy thing they wanted to do, despite everyone telling them not to."
"The Robotics team consisted of three boys and one girl, Kristen Valles*, who joined the team despite the fact that she ""couldn't help much because [she didn't] know anything about robots""."
"I thought she was simply playing, doing the Lego equivalent of doodling, until she leaned back and silently tested a working sampling probe designed fundamentally differently than anything the boys were arguing about."
"I looked at the boys to see if they realised what had happened, but they were all oblivious to her actions and indeed her very presence."
"When I looked back at Kristen, she was just as silently deconstructing her work."
Then she sat quietly and waited for their argument to end.
"In four classes over three years, that gender acculturation would play out so many times one could think it staged."
"If two or more boys were together, they would argue over who was right."
"It was as if every boy lived in his own American Cassandra myth, sure that he held the truth, and ready to fight until he was victorious, despite the collateral damage."
"Girls, by contrast, would most often just solve the problem."
"It was common to have girls suggest they try another person's design and then try theirs - a tactic I thought was based on confidence in the other's failure until (with remarkable slowness) I recognised that it was actually an efficient way to avoid an argument by giving another person voice, while simultaneously testing all solutions to find the best."
It looked to me as though girls obviously had the better strategy for solving problems.
The boy's core competency seemed to be fighting.
"As a company it is something like two percent black and embroiled in a legal battle with the US Department of Labor over ""discrimination against women [that] is quite extreme, even in this industry""."
Many who question gender diversity are rarely conscious of the homogeneity of their immediate surroundings.
Diversity can easily live out a similar existence as a check mark on white America's to-do list if it follows a similar methodology of white men wanting to feel good about themselves without inviting anyone else into the room.
One immediately notices the overwhelming number of white male responses focusing on what the author did or should have done.
"Contrast this with the (fewer) number of responses from women, most of which focus on their own experiences."
As if the mass incarceration of black men for generations has meant nothing.
"During my anthropology research over three years, nearly all eighth-grade girls I interviewed indicated they were not good at science and mathematics - even those planning to choose it as a career."
"Those girls decided they would simply have to work harder or, in the words of one heartbreaking response, ""maybe not be as good, but still do my best""."
"By contrast, most boys thought they were good at maths and science."
"Even more to the point, most boys thought that girls were not as good as boys at maths and science."
"Let this sink in: By the age of 10, the US has successfully conditioned her boys to assume that girls can't do maths and science, at least not as well as they can."
"Suggesting women aren't suited to hi-tech jobs because of ""genetic differences"" is something any one of my 10-year-old boys would have written."
"Girls aren't as good, it's innate, no big deal."
"Google's solution was to fire him, make a weak statement about ""core values,"" and get back to working on that discrimination lawsuit."
"Rather than ostracise him into martyrdom, I'd rather his manifesto be ignored - or used as an example to teach other 10-year-old boys - while we move forward on actually doing the hard work of social equality that we should, but obviously are not, doing."
"At the very least, we should stop dramatically shouting about his wrongness as if we don't implicitly support both his fundamental position and the atmosphere that gave to its publication."
"Unless you're a brown-skinned lesbian without a trust fund, you need to admit you have some skin in his game."
"Even I, as a straight male, am complicit."
This was made clear to me two decades before it was even written in the way I embarrassed the only girl on a team by thoughtlessly calling her out in front of her classmates.
"""While all of you were arguing, she built a design better than all of yours."
"""They were arguing,"" she said, ""so I thought their designs were better""."
"And one of them was eventually chosen, because the boy who designed it was confident, assertive, and most of all kept fighting."
"In the US, he who argues loudest and longest reigns victorious, regardless of the collateral damage."
"Although the United Nations Charter guarantees gender equality for all member states, today gender disparities remain a global issue and addressing them is a top priority for international organisations."
Reducing and ultimately erasing the gender gap is both a moral obligation but also a crucial ingredient for economic development .
By limiting women's access to education and economic opportunities an immeasurable amount of human resources are lost and a significant part of the population is not able to develop its full potential.
"As the digital age transforms the way we go about our daily lives, we can observe such gender disparities transfer into the online world."
"But are online gender disparities a full reflection of inequality ""on the ground""?"
"To quantify gender inequality around the globe and to track changes over time, for example in response to policies put in place, the World Economic Forum annually publishes the ""Global Gender Gap Report"" ."
This report ranks countries according to a numerical gender gap score.
These scores can be interpreted as the percentage of the inequality between women and men that has been closed.
"The emphasis of the report is on the relative gender difference for the variables considered, rather than the absolute level achieved by women."
"So a country where both men and women have extremely limited, but equal access to education and economic opportunities would be ranked higher than a country where both men and women fare better in absolute terms, but where men do disproportionately better."
"Its scores are based on ""hard data"" such as the ratio of female-to-male earned income and the ratio of women-to-men in terms of years in executive office ."
"In our own research, done by Gabriel Magno and myself at Qatar Computing Research Institute , we augment the Global Gender Gap Report by incorporating a new dimension: activity on online social networks."
"In other words, we are interested in questions such as whether countries where men have a higher online ""status"" than women are also countries with large gender inequalities."
"Knowing the answer could, for example, help develop real-time, global indicators of reduction in gender gaps."
"Whereas in Google+ users explicitly stated their gender and their country, we had to infer both of these for Twitter users."
The most likely gender was inferred using a first-name-to-gender dictionary.
"We analysed data for 45 countries for which we have data for at least 1,000 female and 1,000 male users, both for Google+ and Twitter."
Using this data we observed the expected behaviour of the user number gap: countries with relatively fewer female users of Google+ or Twitter were countries with more pronounced gender inequalities.
"In this visualisation, this can be seen by looking at the distribution of red (female Twitter users in data sample) vs blue (male Twitter users in data sample) in a pie chart and observing that in countries with smaller fractions of the gender gap closed, marked in lighter green, male Twitter users tend to outnumber female users."
"We were also expecting to see the same pattern with respect to ""status"" of women online."
In countries with large offline gender inequalities women would have a lower status online compared to men.
"Similarly, Pakistani women on Twitter have on average more followers (600 vs 222) and are included in more Twitter lists."
"One possible explanation for this phenomenon may be selection bias: If a woman in a very unfavourable environment is still very active online then she is likely to be an overachiever and might be representing the so-called ""Jackie Robinson Effect""."
"Similarly, one might imagine that women who are online in countries where women have more limited access to the internet compared to men must be extraordinary to begin with."
"This phenomenon has also been observed in politics, where women are often compelled to perform better than men becaue doing ""just equally well"" would not suffice to ""make it"" onto the political arena."
Measuring global digital gender gaps can be a first step towards implementing policies to reduce the gap.
"About 90 percent of the editors of Wikipedia are male, so that's a problem we need to fix""."
"Wikipedia has been working to increase the diversity of its content and contributors through outreach programmes such as edit-a-thons at universities and museums and by trying to appoint more women administrators, but the site has yet to see any significant change."
"Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir and Indira Gandhi were powerful women ."
Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge?
"Moreover, he says, ""over the long sweep of history, women have been and will be a pacifying force."
"Traditional war is a man's game: tribal women never band together to raid neighbouring villages""."
"As mothers, women have evolutionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to nurture their offspring and ensure that their genes survive into the next generation."
Skeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power.
"If they were empowered as leaders, the conditions of an anarchic world would force them to make the same bellicose decisions that men do."
"Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir and Indira Gandhi were powerful women; all of them led their countries to war."
"But it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of ""a man's world""."
It was their success in conforming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place.
"Head to Head - War on women, war on liberty?"
So we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership?
"In terms of stereotypes, various psychological studies show that men gravitate to the hard power of command, while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion."
"Americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes, but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a ""feminine style""."
"Masculine style' In information-based societies, networks are replacing hierarchies, and knowledge workers are less deferential."
"""Women still lag in leadership positions, holding only 5 per cent of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures."
"Former US President George W Bush once described his role as ""the decider"", but there is much more to modern leadership than that."
"Women's non-hierarchical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowledge-based organisations and groups that men, on average, are less well prepared to meet."
"In the past, when women fought their way to the top of organisations, they often had to adopt a ""masculine style"", violating the broader social norm of female ""niceness""."
"Now, however, with the information revolution and democratisation demanding more participatory leadership, the ""feminine style"" is becoming a path to more effective leadership."
"In order to lead successfully, men will not only have to value this style in their women colleagues, but will also have to master the same skills."
"Women still lag in leadership positions, holding only 5 per cent of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures (just 16 per cent in the US, for example, compared to 45 per cent in Sweden)."
"One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the 20th century found only 27 women, roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler."
Less than 1 per cent of 20th-century rulers were women who gained power on their own.
"So, given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman's world, why are women not doing better?"
"Lack of experience, primary caregiver responsibilities, bargaining style and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap."
"Traditional career paths and the cultural norms that constructed and reinforced them, simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organisational contexts."
"Research shows that even in democratic societies, women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career-related resources such as compensation."
"Women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organisations, and gender stereotypes still hamper women who try to overcome such barriers."
"This bias is beginning to break down in information-based societies, but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as ""a woman's world""."
"Even positive stereotypes are bad for women, men and effective leadership."
"Questions of appropriate style - when to use hard and soft skills - are equally relevant for men and women, and should not be clouded by traditional gender stereotypes."
"In some circumstances, men will need to act more ""like women""; in others, women will need to be more ""like men""."
"The key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender, but on how leaders combine hard- and soft-power skills to produce smart strategies."
Both men and women will make those decisions.
But Pinker is probably correct when he notes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the empowerment of women.
"Head to Head - War on women, war on liberty?"
"But as a woman who swims daily as a kind of psychic balancing act - and who has swum in pools around the globe - it would seem that the humble pool has also become a vortex for the heady collision of feminism, public mores, and Islamophobia."
It's a seasonal battleground for that age old issue - control of women's bodies.
"After doing a dutiful kilometre swim one afternoon, I retreated to the women's change room - a safe space, one would think, for a woman to be semi-nude."
"But as I dried off and put on middle-aged underwear, I was met by the stares of a young teenage boy and the glares of his hijabed, fully-clothed Lebanese mother and aunts."
"I protested that the boy was far too old to be in the women's change area - while they screamed that I should be ashamed of ""exposing"" my body to a ""vulnerable child""."
"Blond English women tut-tutted and rolled their eyes in my ""defence"", while one of the aunts called me a ""slut"" in Arabic."
"This was a far cry from my experience of swimming in a segregated north Tehran pool, where the women welcomed me in my relatively modest one piece and wanted to chat about the latest fashions in bathing costumes."
"Everywhere, it seems, there is an ongoing uproar about women swimmers' bodies and the degree to which they are covered or uncovered."
"A few weeks ago a young Canadian woman named Susan Rowbottom was bathing topless at public beach in British Columbia (BC) when a male Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer told her that she had to cover up, in spite of the fact that bathing topless for men or women is not illegal in the province of BC."
"An 8 year old girl, in Guelph, Ontario this summer, was told she had to cover up her bare chest at a public wading pool or leave."
"Based on these 'damned if you do, damned if you don't scenarios, it would seem the main issue is women, with bodies, occupying public space."
"And a young English mother in Northampton, UK was told by a lifeguard to stop breast-feeding her infant son in a public pool because it was ""unhygienic"" and made some of the men ""feel uncomfortable""."
"Then there is the case of the three sisters Alysha, Tameera, and Nadia Mohamed who were stopped by an officer for cycling topless in Kitchener, Ontario this summer that has since become a ""cause celebre"" for the ""free the nipple"" campaign - one that supports feminine body equality and empowerment through social action."
"The three Mohamed sisters had ostensibly Muslim names, which, in the wake of the new Canadian C-51 anti-terror legislation, (which has been used to target activists of all stripes) made me wonder whether flashing an errant nipple might also be deemed an ""act of terror""."
"After all, the power of the bare breast has been used to great effect by North African feminists protesting post Arab Spring patriarchy and censorship."
"When a 19-year-old Tunisian woman Amina Tyler posted a photo of herself smoking a cigarette with, ""My body belongs to me, and is not the source of anyone's honour"", written in Arabic script across her bare chest, she ignited a global ""topless jihad"" movement aimed at women's empowerment."
"But, apparently, it's not only ""uncovered"" female body parts that make certain people feel ""uncomfortable"" - it's also a crime for women to be ""too"" covered up."
"Canadian lawyer Faisal Kutty successfully represented a hijab-wearing Muslim woman who was ejected with her two children - a boy and girl wearing identical long shorts and t-shirts - from her Toronto apartment pool for wearing ""inappropriate"" and ""un-Canadian"" attire (although the boy's clothing was not at issue)."
"After Muslim-American Nahida Farunia was asked to remove her hijab at a public swimming pool in Ohio, she complained to the town's mayor - and now sits on a community relations panel aimed at bridging cultural gaps between Muslims and other residents."
"But despite such happy hijab endings, controversies about women's bodies and swimming go on."
"Funny, but I don't recall similar headlines obsessing about men and what they wear - or don't wear - in swimming pools."
"In the midst of this potent pool of politics, aesthetics, and public mores, I'm reminded of an interview I did many years ago with Egyptian feminist writer Nawal-al-Sadawi - who managed to invoke the wrath of both Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, and the Muslim Brotherhood, and whose short story about a pious widow who eagerly awaits reunion with her husband in paradise, only to find him pre-occupied with 72 virgins, remains a classic."
"When I asked her about feminism and Islam, she replied that ""the Western equivalent of the veil is plastic surgery and mask-like make up""."
"I eagerly await the day when headlines are less obsessed with women's appearance - and more concerned with issues like economic empowerment, wage parity, universal day-care, and the eradication of domestic violence and global sex trafficking - to name a few."
"Hadani Ditmars is the author of Dancing in the No Fly Zone: a Woman's Journey Through Iraq, and has been reporting from Iraq since 1997."
"Women in the US are being encouraged to participate in a strike intended to raise awareness over issues including economic inequality, reproductive rights, civil liberties and ending violence."
"The one-day protest on Wednesday, labelled as A Day Without a Woman, is aimed at calling attention to economic bias faced by women."
"Organisers called on women to take the day off of work or school, and said they should not spend money, in an attempt to highlight women's role in society."
"NYC Yemenis close bodegas to protest Trump travel ban ""Stand with women around the globe,"" they said."
"According to an official website, men could take part by ""consider[ing] the ways that the women in your life care for and support you ."
The planned strike coincides with the UN-designated International Women's Day.
Organisers acknowledged that many women would not be able to participate in the strike for financial or practical reasons.
"Many women in our most vulnerable communities will not have the ability to join the strike, due to economic insecurity."
Opposing Trump 'not enough' Organisers also want to show solidarity with the majority-women protests held around the world after Trump's inauguration in January.
"""The massive women's marches of January 21 may mark the beginning of a new wave of militant feminist struggle,"" the organisers said‚ as they announced the protest in The Guardian newspaper."
"To signify love and sacrifice, women should wear red on the day, they said."
"In an interview with Goodcast, an online channel aimed at American Muslims, civil rights activist Linda Sarsour said: ""Women are [one] of the largest consumer groups."
"If you have to shop that day, we encourage you to support women or minority-owned businesses""."
"The problem, however, is that male and female farmers have deeply unequal rights to critical resources, including water."
"Not all women farmers are equal While women grow the majority of food in this region, public programmes and policies are skewed towards providing water for male livelihood activities."
This bias undermines female farmers' ability to adapt to climate change and weakens the food security of the region.
"In the semi-arid, southern African country of Botswana, women rely heavily on irrigation to grow vegetables during the long dry season."
"What these appraisals overlook is the critical role that water access plays in the success of a women's vegetable production operation, and the overall way in which women's farming activities are marginalised in the country."
"In fact, differences in water access among female vegetable farmers in Botswana had a huge influence on whether or not commercial horticulture helps improve household food security."
"Wealthy female farmers have the financial resources, or access to credit, to invest in boreholes."
"For these women, increasing commercialisation of vegetable production (or selling a larger share of their crop) leads to clear gains in household food security."
"This contrasts with poorer female gardeners who can't afford a well, and water their gardens with purchased tap water."
"Wealthier female farmers with land can afford the upfront costs of a borehole, and often have the necessary connections to successfully engage with the market, allowing them to cover the costs of their initial investment and go on to make a reasonable profit that enhances their food security."
"Climate change and female farmers in Botswana Second, in Botswana there is a significant gender component to water access."
"The historical significance of the cattle industry, which is dominated by men, has meant that government agencies and programmes support the development of water sources for cattle to the exclusion of other agricultural activities."
A national system that gives first priority to male livelihoods forces female horticulturalists to either find creative ways to negotiate these constraints or to see their gardens flounder and household food security benefits dwindle.
In Botswana it means that government programmes supporting women's gardening activities will not be successful unless they recognise and address female farmers' unequal access to water.
"Addressing women's inequitable access to water resources will only become more important in Southern Africa as the region grapples with climate change, increasing rainfall variability and growing need for irrigation."
"His biggest problem was that citizens whose lives and nation harmed by his rule, were fighting back, and they had found an effective medium through which to organise and express their protest."
"Pollitt's comments were followed up by a Nation cover story called ""Feminism's Toxic Twitter Wars"", which described Twitter as a site of ""Maoist hazing"" and ""perpetual psychodrama""."
"The antagonists of Goldberg's ""Toxic Twitter"" were female activists of colour, although particular wrath was reserved for Mikki Kendall, a prominent black intellectual best known for starting the hashtag SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to highlight the lack of support for women of colour in the mainstream feminist community."
"The hashtag was partly inspired by white feminist defence of Hugo Schwyzer, a writer who had attacked women of colour online and confessed to numerous acts of harassment, describing himself as ""a breathtakingly cocky fraud"" and a ""piss-poor feminist""."
"""Many consider her a bully, though few want to say so out loud,"" she wrote in the pages of a magazine to which over 100,000 people subscribe."
"""Feminism as a global movement meant to unite all women has global responsibilities, and - as illustrated by hundreds of tweets - has failed at one of the most basic: It has not been welcoming to all women, or even their communities,"" she wrote in the Guardian last August."
"Since then, she and other female intellectuals of colour have used Twitter hashtags to draw attention to social issues like poverty, racism, stereotypes, media bias and the sexual exploitation of black girls."
"In the view of Goldberg and others, this renders some women ""afraid to speak""."
"""So glad [Goldberg] wrote about online feminist toxicity in The Nation."
"In the last few months, mainstream authors have bullied a cancer patient, inspired a transgender woman to commit suicide, and argued that violence against black men is justified."
"Gatekeepers to mainstream feminist venues, like Jezebel founder Anna Holmes, proclaim that tweeting is not really activism."
"In contrast, the women behind hashtag activism argue that Twitter is one of the few outlets they have in a world that denies them opportunities."
Her statement mirrors those of activists around the world who use Twitter to oppose repressive governments.
"As such the concept of 'Twitter feminism' strikes us as dismissive and probably a misnomer""."
"Media is one form of power, and hashtag feminism is an attempt to challenge the narratives that bolster discriminatory practices."
"Hashtag feminism makes visible what was never truly invisible, but what people refuse to see."
"In her history ""The Warmth of Other Suns"", Pulitzer-prize winning author Isabel Wilkerson describes the migration of African-Americans fleeing the Jim Crow south."
"She notes that their migration resembled the pattern of those fleeing famine, war, and genocide, despite the fact that African-Americans were moving within their own country."
"A landmark ruling in Lebanon in favour of a transgender man is being celebrated as a leap towards equality, with hopes that discrimination against the transgender community will ease given the subsequent positive media attention the case has received."
"In the mid-January ruling at the Court of Appeals in Beirut, Judge Janet Hanna confirmed the right of a transgender man to change his official papers, granting him access to necessary treatment and, importantly, privacy."
The decision marked the first time a Lebanese appeals court has ruled specifically in support of transgender rights to treatment.
"When the details were announced, some media outlets welcomed the ruling as the first time a Lebanese was able to change gender."
"But changing one's gender was already legal in Lebanon, as in Iran, Egypt and many other countries."
"Hanna, the judge, has been hailed by activists and the transgender community, as the court recognised when a person does not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth."
"Until now, granting papers that would officially change one's gender depended on a set of stringent rules: the man or woman must not be married, have any children, and should be able to prove that gender realignment surgery is complete and irreversible."
"""First, the court recognised the appellant's request to reflect their personal status in accordance with their gender."
"The second aspect was that it [the court] affirmed the appellant's right to 'correct' the discrepancy between their reality and their gender identity, and affirmed their right to privacy in this matter."
"There are no statistics relating to Lebanon's transgender community, but members and activists estimate the minority to be at least in the low thousands."
The main barrier for transgender men and women in Lebanon is that their identification documents do not match their gender.
"Getting a job and renting property become tasks of immeasurable difficulty, and so, many turn to sex work to ""make ends meet"", said Zeidan."
"Coupled with high levels of family rejection, many suffer from feelings of abandonment, isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem."
"The whole system in Lebanon is set up based on a binary gender system, including prison and police stations."
"If [for example] a trans woman is arrested, she will frequently be placed in a holding cell for men."
"In America, doors often closed to transgender tenants searching for housing Yara (not her real name) presents as male and is transitioning to female."
She spoke to Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity.
"She said that there is widespread fear of Lebanon's Internal Security Forces, which are responsible for ""maintaining public order""."
"""We fear that someone might call security and accuse us of perversion; this creates a lot of anxiety,"" Yara said."
"""When they drag an LGBT person to jail and torture and abuse them, they believe they are doing something right, removing something 'bad' from society""."
"Yara confirmed that mismatched identification records makes access to employment a monumental barrier, forcing many to leave the country once gender realignment surgery is completed."
"Once her transition is complete, she too will try and leave Lebanon."
"As for surgery, trans men and women elect to have the procedure in North America, Europe and Thailand as there are few facilities in Lebanon which perform the surgery, and they are not only considered inferior quality but also pose a risk."
"Some doctors object to the procedure, and it is not unheard of for ""deeply religious"" psychiatrists to attempt to persuade patients not to go ahead with it, Yara said."
"Access to healthcare relating to gender realignment is difficult and expensive, she added, and is not covered sufficiently by social security or most insurers."
"""When the law recognises a certain minority, it empowers them"" This was an authority saying that these people exist and they need our care,"" she said, speaking from Beirut."
"In terms of LGBT support from activists and non-government organisations, a network is growing."

"There has been positive coverage of the transgender community's situation, which in turn puts them in a better position in society,"" Makhlouf told Al Jazeera."
It doesn't mean all of the problems regarding transgenders in Lebanon are solved.
Makhlouf has around 20 transgender clients who seek her legal advice.
"There are much bigger problems, like not having a job, turning to prostitution, encountering physical violence and not having access to a legal system when you are in sex work."
"In the criminal code, there is no incrimination of transgender - the problem is that some people would be rejected."
I've been arrested and locked down in custody for 16 days because they thought I was a prostitute.
"I also had to face problems with the staff at Nepalgunj airport as they didn't believe I was the same person in my passport,"" said Sipha Choudari, a transgender Nepali, while showing the citizenship card of the man she's not."
"Last year, Nepal became one of the world's few countries to officially recognise a third gender in citizenship documents, following a 2007 Supreme Court decision."
The small nation wedged between China and India has been providing more rights to gender and sexual minorities ever since.
The legal benchmark established self-determination as the sole criterion to identify one's gender.
But only a handful of people have so far been given a citizenship card with the new identity.
"Nepalese local and district administrations still request proof to certify one's gender, while the central government only issues citizenship cards with the third category to new applicants."
"""We have challenged district and local governments to the court again so that they don't put obstacles to this law,"" explained Asia's first openly gay federal-level politician Sunil Babu Pant, who took the Nepalese government to court in 2007."
"The Supreme Court decision urged the government not only to include a third category in citizenship cards, but also to scrap all discriminatory laws against sexual minorities and to form a committee to study same-sex marriage."
The current civil and criminal code considers 'unnatural sex' illegal.
"The report about same-sex marriage is prepared, but the Ministry of Health is holding it."
"It only requires political will to submit it to the Council of Ministers and the Parliament,"" said lawyer Hari Phuyal, who was involved in the first Nepalese case ruling in favour of a live-in relationship for two lesbians."
"Nepal's advance towards legal recognition of sexual and gender minorities has been cheered by the international community, becoming a model in the region."
"However, the current interim government still has to draft an inclusive constitution for more than 100 different ethnic and social minorities."
"Semanta Dahal, a prominent lawyer in Kathmandu, described the legal context: ""The current civil and criminal code considers 'unnatural sex' illegal."
"Nevertheless, the Supreme Court decision set a precedent, and the Nepalese electoral commission as well as some banks and trekking agencies begun including anya, or ""other"", as the third category in registration forms."
"Following these steps, Nepal's 2011 census allowed citizens to choose the third category, but problems with recording details made counting impossible."
The unsuccessful census prevented Nepal from becoming the first country to officially count people self-identifying as a third gender.
"Budgets often take census data into account, and the absence of those identifying their gender as ""other"" on the census means that they will likely not benefit from government spending that could help to alleviate the discrimination many face in their daily lives."
"Marginalised Transgender Swastika Lama faces daily difficulties in opening a bank account, getting telephone cards, renting a room or applying for jobs because of physical appearance."
"""Sexual minorities, especially transgender, aren't welcomed in any other jobs but prostitution."
"Everybody discourages you to apply and humiliates you by saying, 'How did you ever think you can get a job like this?"
"The marginalisation can have dire consequences: After the floods in Nepal's Sunsari district in 2008, residents identifying as metis (male-bodied feminine people) reported discrimination, claiming they didn't receive food supplies due to their appearance."
"For me and many more other people in Nepal, you can't be identified as third gender."
"Political representation of sexual and gender minorities, they believe, would help fight stigmatisation and discrimination in Nepalese society."
"In 2013, New York-based‚ Human Rights Watch denounced‚ what it called arbitrary arrests and government harassment of the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex) community."
"""For me and many more other people in Nepal, you can't be identified as third gender,"" said Shiva Achariya, a human rights officer at the National Centre for AIDS and STD Control, a part of Nepal's Ministry of Health."
"The government is struggling with the constitution, and the LGBTI issues are very insignificant for the government to look after."
Political decisions in the near future will determine Nepal's future as a regional model for sexual and gender rights.
"But Dr Mira Mishra, a professor of gender studies at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, highlights the need to change social attitudes as well."
"Young people should be the target because young people are relatively open, and want a more humane and just Nepali society""."

"Sydney, Australia - Since the world's first elected female political leader, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, became prime minister of Sri Lanka in 1960, 63 countries have elected women to their highest office."
Yet only fourteen countries have a woman at the helm today.
"Many who have had one woman in charge have yet to be led by a woman again, such as Britain, where Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, Israel, where Golda Meir was dubbed ""the best man in government"",Ã‚ and Canada, once led - if only for a few months -Ã‚ by Kim Campbell."

"While her death prompted an outpouring of vitriol, feminist publisher Anne Summers described an online campaign to push the song Ding Dong the Witch is Dead to the top of Britain's music charts as ""shocking""."
"A radio host asked her whether her partner, hairdesser Tim Matheson, was gay - while a menu for a Liberal Party fundraiser contained a reference to Gillard's supposedly ""small breasts, big thighs and big red box""."
"Opposition leader Tony Abbott was labelled a misogynist when he was pictured in front of a sign calling Gillard a ""bitch"" at a protest rally against the unpopular carbon tax."
"Amanda Vanstone, a former Howard government minister, told Al Jazeera while ""coarse and reprehensible language shouldn't be tolerated"", the now infamous image was not evidence of sexism."
"Oh you stupid bitch, what are you doing?"
"Summers asserts Gillard was subject to ""the whole repertoire"" of abuse, because she was an unmarried atheist with no children."
"In 2007, Bill Heffernan, a conservative senator, called Gillard, then deputy-opposition leader, ""deliberately barren"" and questioned her leadership credentials because she chose not to have children."
"It was the kind of sexualised imagery that would not happen to a male leader, according to Summers."
"""There is still engrained in most of our institutions a belief by a lot of people that women don't belong in Australian society outside the home after they've had children, so women should have no role in the public life of Australia,"" she said."
"It genuinely drives me nuts when we debate 'can women have it all', because we don't even consider that phrase when we talk about men."
"Natasha Stott Despoja, former‚ Australian senator‚ Stott Despoja believes the ""novelty factor"" of her gender was enhanced because of her age, 26, when she entered parliament."
We still debate a woman's suitability for office in the context of: 'Is she married?'
Does she have children?
"Issues of sexuality, either hers or that of her partner, how she dresses, what she wears, how she appears."
"Stott Despoja is proud of how she juggled family and a political career, but laments those questions were never asked of her male colleagues."
"""It genuinely drives me nuts when we debate 'can women have it all', because we don't even consider that phrase when we talk about men,"" she said."
"Despite concerns that Gillard's experience would be a disincentive to women entering politics, Australia's first female prime minister remained positive in her concession speech."
"""What I am‚ absolutely confident of is it‚ will be easier for the next‚ woman and the woman after that‚ and the woman after that,"" she said."
"At a conference, on gender violence held in Rabat, Morocco in late January, UN Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo commended the country on its recently introduced draft bill protecting women against violence."
"The Moroccan government paid attention to the issue‚ following a 2006 United Nations study showed the extent to which violence prevented women from fulfilling their potential, restricted economic growth and undermined development."
"Given the exigent consequences of violence against women on the economic welfare of communities, it became one of Morocco's pressing obligations to seriously address the issue."
"However, despite the advances Moroccan legislation made to improve women's rights."
The article protects a rapist from prosecution if he married his victim.
"Moreover, female victims of violence are often presumed to be accomplices and questions of consent overshadow the harm they've incurred."
"In order for women to feel protected against violence, a culture of zero tolerance for rape must be enforced."
"Female victims of violence in Morocco need to feel that they can trust the system to protect their rights and bring them justice without having to resort to extreme ""solutions""."
There are women's rights groups and civil society actors in Morocco who work freely to promote gender equality and equal access to justice in the country.
"Furthermore, few have conducted research on the human, material and financial resources of the civil society organisations working with rural women."
"As Moroccan Minister of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development Bassima Hakkaoui has repeatedly said more resources and support must be allocated to women's shelters."
Something as simple as a road can make the difference between whether a wronged woman in a village can obtain access to justice or not.
"Many women, including Amina, who had to make trips from Larache to Tangier to attend court hearings, do not have physical access to legal aid or the resources of non-profit organisations."
"Many more are unaware or misinformed about their legal rights, and many lawyers refuse to take on pro-bono cases or lower their service rates for victims in rural areas."
All women who have been subject to violence must have access to a legal counsel - justice should not have a price tag.
Compliance with international standards It is not entirely true to say that progress has not been made on improving women's rights in Morocco.
"Article 336 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which previously only allowed women to take civil action against their husbands with prior authorisation from the court was also changed, now granting women equal access to the legal system."
Morocco has also taken unprecedented steps in the country's history to help eradicate discrimination against women and to improve gender equality by ratifying international instruments of human rights.
The country is party to several international rights agreements including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
These are all encouraging steps forward in Morocco's path to protecting women against violence and to preserving their rights.
Morocco has committed to preventing discrimination against women and to assuring gender parity with regards to human rights.
"However, despite these international commitments, shortcomings in the status of women's legal rights in Morocco still prevail."
"A common discrepancy between implementation and international commitments, for example, is with the minimum age for marriage and Article 2 of the CEDAW which urges state parties to refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions conform to this obligation."
"Though Moroccan law sets the minimum age for marriage at 18 for both males and females, judges often waive this requirement at their own discretion, allowing female minors to get married."
"The laws are bent because culturally speaking, girls tend to marry far older men and are often married when they are under 18."
"Today, the advances Morocco has achieved since the millennium have contributed largely to improving many human development indicators, especially for women."
It remains one of the many examples of how societies in the Middle East and North Africa are increasingly grappling with balancing tradition and the human imperative of making society‚ more just for women.

"I wondered, if we eventually moved in together, would I be paying all the bills since I don't believe in bartering and I like a decent place above poverty wages with cable, etc."
"I'd love to come along, it sounds fascinating!"
I'll do a blow post about teasing some time this Fall.
I'm a grown woman now and I can say without hesitation that any man that wants to be in my life better have his own life figured out.
I'm in the challenging situation of being an influence to two late teens who have an abusive mother - I am their Dad's partner after he escaped the abuse.
"I'm not saying that people don't and can't change, but if your love is showing all these signs of infidelity, its likely he's been doing it for a long time."
"I'm not sure the Critic will ever morph into the Wise Woman but if her intentions are purer than her words and gestures would indicate, talking it through will definitely help."
"I'm oversimplifying, but my sense is: girls will let you join in their games if they regard you as a friend."
"I'm speaking as a layperson, of course, but one who has interviewed many women, Whether it's possible to do without physical and emotional distance, alas, isn't entirely up to you but up to your mother and whether she's able to listen to you."
I've been on all sides of this equation and I can recognize you all a mile away.
I've been single for about a year now and I'm starting to believe everyone was right.
"I've lived this from every angle and every different scenario for the past 40 years, as the daughter, mother, step-mother, etc..."
I've observed the phenomenon you describe at my son's day care centres and summer camps.
"If a guy in a hurry to move things forward quickly, it's usually not because he wants commitment."
"If a guy is really into you, he will make it a point to be seen as much as he possibly can even to the point of maybe being a little creepy."

"If a new boy came along, all he had to do was start building with blocks or Legs next to the older boys, and in no time, he was an integral part of the group."
"If a woman is fully disinterested in talking to you, she will not turn her body toward you."
"If a woman notices all her social media friends travelling and being adventurous with their partner, yet the peak of romance for her involves stakeout and Netflix, she's not going to be super excited to stay in yet another Friday night."
"If all else fails to bring that boy to action, you have to come right out and call him on it:"
"If all goes well, don't rush and tell your parents."
"If all of a sudden he has a gym membership and never discussed it with you, start feeling concerned for your relationship."
"If any of this seems a bit overwhelming, don't worry, you have plenty of time and plenty of room for making mistakes."
"If anything, the child controls the parent."
"If attention is drawn away from the mother, the child suffers retaliation, put-downs, and punishments."
"If boys can carry the seeds of marital disruption into the next generation, girls suffer consequences of parental marital distress here and now."
"If close, the relationship can simulate friendship through the familiar characteristics of empathy, listening, loyalty, and caring."
"If communication in relationships is really important to you, then shut up."
"If everyone always told you how fabulous you are, it's no stretch to start believing it."
"If he (or you) lets your knees linger together, that's an even clearer sign that he's feeling it."
"If he always gets weird when he's on his computer, then he's probably just looking at pornography."
"If he always seems to be around wherever you are, you can bet he likes you."
"If he barely knows you and is making comments like, You're the perfect girl, or, I'd marry you tomorrow, he's intentionally trying to bring your guard downland not in a good way."
"If he can, you're on solid ground."
"If he comes home smelling like someone else perfume or smelling of sex, this is a dead give-away."
If he doesn't (or can't) you've just saved yourself an eternity of miserable awkward silence.

"If he leans in with you, you're in."
"If he left a girlfriend or wife to be with you, you can make a pretty safe bet that the same thing is going to happen to you."
"If he looks away first and then looks right back at you, you are probably dealing with a shy guy who is definitely showing signs he is into you!"
"If he mentions playing an instrument or mentioning something he's proud of, tell him you'd really like to see him do exactly what he just described."
"If he only does it when he's expecting something in return or after he's messed up in some way, your guy might be a little selfish."
"If he says it in a funny way while smiling, the are in!"
"If he says it in a mean way or insults you loud enough for others to hear, then he might actually just be a jerk."
"If he says, I'm not against vegans in theory, that doesn't mean he's going to become a vegan."
"If he seems shady or dangerous to your heart, there is an overwhelming chance that he probably is going to be a cheater."
"If he sees us as ageing and undesirable, we internalize that, too, she writes."
"If he shows any signs of using violence to settle his problems, jealousy is usually not far behind."
"If he smells like a fresh shower, something up."
"If he stares you down until you look away, it's a little more difficult to decipher."
"If he starts suggesting or attempting sexual acts that seem above your skill level or just a little too kinky, he might be learning new things from someone else."
"If he starts to change his behaviour including becoming cold or even super-loving, something has definitely happened in his life to make that change."
"If he sticks by you even when you are feeling moody and depressed, you've got yourself a winner."
"If he wants to be next to you, often or always, he's probably interested."
"If he's accusing you of cheating on him, especially if its out of the blue and for no apparent reason, then he knows something"

"If he's irritated or concerned or curious about what you're saying, he'll raise one eyebrow or frequently downturn his brows."

"If he's only testing you after 11:00 a.m., and claims he misses you, it's not your smile he's missing."
"If he's reaching out to you a lot, or speaking directly to you in a group thread, chances are you are on his mind."
"If he's rich, but he hates his 80 hour a week job, he's bound to be permanently miserable."
"If he's showing all the signs of an affair and its that obvious, Its likely to mean that he's been doing it for a long time and has got careless in covering up his tell-tale signs of infidelity."
If he's shy he might avoid eye contact at all costs if he really likes you.
"If he's the type to date around, he'll be more likely to let you know that too."
"If he's way too stupid, you find yourself dumbing down what you talk about just to engage him."

So he's doing most if not all the signs of attraction and the readings on the Does He Like Me Scale are through the roof.
So how can you determine if he really is the one?

"So many mom spoke to us about how happy they are to be finished with the 'eye rolling' and look from their adolescent daughters, a look that says, 'You must come from a different evolutionary chain than me.' Daughters also adopted the famous Mark Twain quote about ageing, with some slight alterations, and their feelings about their mothers."
"So maybe this doesn't happen to you, but it doesn't have to for you to understand what's really happening here."
So much so that I included it in what I call the Ten Stingers of mother-daughter dynamics when the mother has a high level of narcissistic traits.
So now he finds himself making tons of excuses as to why he has to leave or will be home very late or even go away on a job related trip.

The bottom line is this: the relationship between adult daughters and their mothers is an area that demands more attention than the culture has given it.
The bottom line: relationship fulfilment depends on a number of unique factors that sometimes science just can't explain.
The challenge for daughters of narcissistic mothers is to learn how to recognize and cope with abnormal maternal envy.
The child attacks the parent with whom they have the most secure attachment and idolizes the parent that they have the insecure attachment/bond to.
"The child son wants to glorify the man, but when he does, come time for adolescence, his dad has become such a hero figure there is no way the teenager can measure up to the exemplar he has worshipfully created."
The combination of two partners looking for these seemingly very different qualities can work well (opposites attract after all) but it can also have its disadvantages.
"The common adage is that Mom may make the rules, but Dads enforce them."
The connection between beauty and socio-economic position:
"The critics motivations are various; under the guise of helpfulness, she finds a way to insinuate herself into her daughters life at the very time the daughter is establishing her independence."
The cultural mythologies about mothering as instinctual as well as our ideas about filial duty muddy the waters and stop us from talking about these tensions frankly.
"The cultural myths about motherhood deprive this role of discussion and publicity, even though Absentee fathers are all over the place."
The culture and schools had a lot to do with that.
The dad is missing the point.
The data is in and it says you might want to brush up on your singers.
"The date might end wonderfully, or maybe it wont."
The daughter can be grateful and will seek the mother's help.
The daughter tries her best to make sense of the situation and decides that something must be wrong with her.
The daughter wanted the dresser in one place; the mother put it in another!'
"The daughter, though, feels abandoned and slighted, especially in the early years of adulthood."
"The daughters sense of self is built during the years of her infancy, childhood and adolescence, and highly dependent on her connection to her mother."
"The description of the man above, that could be you."
"The excruciating colonial stereotypes Asian women as submissive, domestic, hyper sexual are obviously nothing new."
The fact is that no one is too old to date.
The fact remains that he is getting really close with another person that he could start an all-in affair with.
The fact that he's lived a long time and accrued wealth is like hitting two birds with one stone.
"The father knows the son whole, but the son can never know the father (294)."
"The father refuses the request, and the son refuses to disobey."
"The father tells his son that if he discovers the enlightenment he seeks, then he should come back and teach it to his father."
The father was not crowded but mostly alone with his own father gone for weeks at a time for work and his mother working long hours and both brothers usually out of the house.
The final (and not so great) thing that could happen is that he makes a smarmy comment about you staring at him.
The first and most important reason you are on this first date is to figure out if the guy you're with is at all interesting to you.
The first and most important step is to put him on a quest!

The intimate nature of the relationship between a mother and daughter is sometimes confusing.

"The most serious father/adolescent son conflicts I see in counselling are when the father pushes his agenda of resemblance ('My way is the right way') so hard that the teenage son feels duty bound to resist ('My life is up to me.') Now the adolescent son will even rebel against self-interest to oppose his father, failing in high school and hurting his future to spite the educational agenda of his father."
"The mother and child relationship is, therefore, more intimate and more intense than any other."
"The mother can be jealous of her daughter for many reasons: her looks, her youth, material possessions, accomplishments, education and even the young girls' relationship with the father."
The mother takes the side of the child as it should be and leaves the offender.
The mother/daughter relationship is so much more comprehensive than the best friendship.
The mothering styles you describe are gross generalizations that have about as much to do with attachment security as the Sun being 93M miles away from Earth.
